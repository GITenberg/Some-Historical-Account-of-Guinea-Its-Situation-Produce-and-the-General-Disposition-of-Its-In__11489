            INTRODUCTION.

         </h2><a name="P_i"></a><p>The slavery of the Negroes
            having, of late, drawn the
            attention of many serious minded
            people; several tracts have been
            published setting forth its inconsistency
            with every christian and moral
            virtue, which it is hoped will
            have weight with the judicious;
            especially at a time when the liberties
            of mankind are become so
            much the subject of general attention.
            For the satisfaction of the
            serious enquirer who may not have
            the opportunity of seeing those
            tracts, and such others who are
            sincerely desirous that the iniquity
            of this practice may become effectually
            apparent, to those in whose
            <a name="P_ii"></a>
            power, it may be to put a stop to
            any farther progress therein; it is
            proposed, hereby, to republish the
            most material parts of said tracts;
            and in order to enable the reader to
            form a true judgment of this matter,
            which, tho' so very important,
            is generally disregarded, or so artfully
            misrepresented by those whose
            interest leads them to vindicate it,
            as to bias the opinions of people
            otherwise upright; some account
            will be here given of the different
            parts of Africa, from which
            the Negroes are brought to America;
            with an impartial relation
            from what motives the Europeans
            were first induced to undertake,
            and have since continued this iniquitous
            traffic. And here it will
            not be improper to premise, that
            <a name="P_iii"></a>
            tho' wars, arising from the common
            depravity of human nature, have
            happened, as well among the Negroes
            as other nations, and the weak
            sometimes been made captives
            to the strong; yet nothing appears,
            in the various relations of
            the intercourse and trade for a
            long time carried on by the Europeans
            on that coast, which
            would induce us to believe, that
            there is any real foundation for
            that argument, so commonly advanced
            in vindication of that trade,
            viz. "<em>That the slavery of the Negroes
               took its rise from a desire,
               in the purchasers, to save the lives
               of such of them as were taken captives
               in war, who would otherwise
               have been sacrificed to the implacable
               revenge of their conquerors.</em>"
            <a name="P_iv"></a>
            A plea which when compared with
            the history of those times, will appear
            to be destitute of Truth;
            and to have been advanced, and
            urged, principally by such as were
            concerned in reaping the gain of this
            infamous traffic, as a palliation of
            that, against which their own reason
            and conscience must have raised
            fearful objections.

         </p>
         <p>When the Negroes are considered
            barely in their present abject state
            of slavery, broken-spirited and dejected;
            <a name="P_2"></a>
            and too easy credit is given to the accounts
            we frequently hear or read of their barbarous
            and savage way of living in their own
            country; we shall be naturally induced to
            look upon them as incapable of improvement,
            destitute, miserable, and insensible of
            the benefits of life; and that our permitting
            them to live amongst us, even on the most
            oppressive terms, is to them a favour. But,
            on impartial enquiry, the case will appear to
            be far otherwise; we shall find that there is
            scarce a country in the whole world, that
            is better calculated for affording the necessary
            comforts of life to its inhabitants, with less
            solicitude and toil, than Guinea. And that
            notwithstanding the long converse of many
            of its inhabitants with (often) the worst of
            the Europeans, they still retain a great deal
            of innocent simplicity; and, when not stirred
            up to revenge from the frequent abuses they
            have received from the Europeans in general,
            manifest themselves to be a humane, sociable
            people, whose faculties are as capable of improvement
            as those of other Men; and
            that their oeconomy and government is, in
            many respects, commendable. Hence it appears
            they might have lived happy, if not
            disturbed by the Europeans; more especially,
            if these last had used such endeavours as their
            christian profession requires, to communicate
            to the ignorant Africans that superior
            <a name="P_3"></a>
            knowledge which Providence had favoured
            them with. In order to set this matter in
            its true light, and for the information of
            those well-minded people who are desirous
            of being fully acquainted with the merits of
            a cause, which is of the utmost consequence;
            as therein the lives and happiness of thousands,
            and hundreds of thousands, of our fellow <em>Men</em>
            have fallen, and are daily falling, a
            sacrifice to selfish avarice and usurped power,
            I will here give some account of the several
            divisions of those parts of Africa from
            whence the Negroes are brought, with a
            summary of their produce; the disposition
            of their respective inhabitants; their improvements,
            &amp;c. &amp;c. extracted from authors
            of credit; mostly such as have been principal
            officers in the English, French and Dutch
            factories, and who resided many years in
            those countries. But first it is necessary to
            premise, as a remark generally applicable to
            the whole coast of Guinea, "<em>That the Almighty,
               who has determined and appointed the
               bounds of the habitation of men on the face of
               the earth</em>" in the manner that is most conducive
            to the well-being of their different
            natures and dispositions, has so ordered it,
            that altho' Guinea is extremely
            unhealthy<a class="notelink" href="#NoteI_FN1"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootI_FN1"></a> to
            <a name="P_4"></a>
            the Europeans, of whom many thousands
            have met there with a miserable and
            <a name="P_5"></a>
            untimely end, yet it is not so with the
            Negroes, who enjoy a good state of health<a class="notelink" href="#NoteI_FN2"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootI_FN2"></a> and
            are able to procure to themselves a comfortable
            subsistence, with much less care and toil
            than is necessary in our more northern climate;
            which last advantage arises not only
            from the warmth of the climate, but also
            from the overflowing of the rivers, whereby
            the land is regularly moistened and rendered
            extremely fertile; and being in many
            places improved by culture, abounds with
            grain and fruits, cattle, poultry, &amp;c. The
            earth yields all the year a fresh supply of
            food: Few clothes are requisite, and little art
            necessary in making them, or in the
            construction of their houses, which are very
            <a name="P_6"></a>
            simple, principally calculated to defend them
            from the tempestuous seasons and wild
            beasts; a few dry reeds covered with matts
            serve for their beds. The other furniture,
            except what belongs to cookery, gives the
            women but little trouble; the moveables of
            the greatest among them amounting only to
            a few earthen pots, some wooden utensils,
            and gourds or calabashes; from these last,
            which grow almost naturally over their huts,
            to which they afford an agreeable shade,
            they are abundantly stocked with good clean
            vessels for most houshold uses, being of different
            sizes, from half a pint to several gallons.

            That part of Africa from which the Negroes
            are sold to be carried into slavery,
            commonly known by the name of Guinea,
            extends along the coast three or four thousand
            miles. Beginning at the river Senegal, situate
            about the 17th degree of North latitude,
            being the nearest part of Guinea, as well to
            Europe as to North America; from thence
            to the river Gambia, and in a southerly course
            to Cape Sierra Leona, comprehends a coast
            of about seven hundred miles; being the
            same tract for which Queen Elizabeth granted
            charters to the first traders to that coast:
            from Sierra Leona, the land of Guinea
            takes a turn to the eastward, extending
            that course about fifteen hundred miles, including
            <a name="P_7"></a>
            those several civilians known by
            name of <i>the Grain Coast, the Ivory Coast, the
               Gold Coast, and the Slave Coast, with the large
               kingdom of Benin</i>. From thence the land runs
            southward along the coast about twelve
            hundred miles, which contains the <i>kingdoms
               of Congo and Angola</i>; there the trade for slaves
            ends. From which to the southermost Cape
            of Africa, called the Cape of Good Hope,
            the country is settled by Caffres and Hottentots,
            who have never been concerned in the
            making or selling slaves.

            Of the parts which are above described,
            the first which presents itself to view, is that
            situate on the great river Senegal, which is
            said to be navigable more than a thousand
            miles, and is by travellers described to be
            very agreeable and fruitful. Andrew Brue,
            principal factor for the French African company,
            who lived sixteen years in that country,
            after describing its fruitfulness and
            plenty, near the sea, adds,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteI_FN3"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootI_FN3"></a> "The farther
            you go from the sea, the country on the
            river seems the more fruitful and well improved;
            abounding with Indian corn,
            pulse, fruit, &amp;c. Here are vast meadows,
            which feed large herds of great and small
            cattle, and poultry numerous: The villages
            that lie thick on the river, shew the
            country is well peopled." The same author,
            <a name="P_8"></a>
            in the account of a voyage he made up
            the river Gambia, the mouth of which lies
            about three hundred miles South of the Senegal,
            and is navigable about six hundred
            miles up the country, says,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteI_FN4"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootI_FN4"></a> "That he was
            surprized to see the land so well cultivated;
            scarce a spot lay unimproved; the
            low lands, divided by small canals, were
            all formed with rice, &amp;c. the higher ground
            planted with millet, Indian corn, and
            pease of different sorts; their beef excellent;
            poultry plenty, and very cheap, as
            well as all other necessaries of life." Francis
            Moor, who was sent from England about
            the year 1735, in the service of the African
            company, and resided at James Fort, on the
            river Gambia, or in other factories on that
            river, about five years, confirms the above
            account of the fruitfulness of the country.
            William Smith, who was sent in the year
            1726, by the African company, to survey their
            settlements throughout the whole coast of
            Guinea<a class="notelink" href="#NoteI_FN5"><sup>C</sup></a><a name="FootI_FN5"></a> says, "The country about the
            Gambia is pleasant and fruitful; provisions
            of all kinds being plenty and exceeding
            cheap." The country on and between
            the two above-mentioned rivers is large and
            extensive, inhabited principally by those
            three Negro nations known by the name of
            Jalofs, Fulis, and Mandingos. The Jalofs
            <a name="P_9"></a>
            possess the middle of the country. The Fulis
            principal settlement is on both sides of the
            Senegal; great numbers of these people are
            also mixed with the Mandingos; which last
            are mostly settled on both sides the Gambia.
            The government of the Jalofs is represented
            as under a better regulation than can be expected
            from the common opinion we entertain
            of the Negroes. We are told in the Collection,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteI_FN6"><sup>D</sup></a><a name="FootI_FN6"></a> "That the King has under him several
            ministers of state, who assist him in the
            exercise of justice. <em>The grand Jerafo</em> is the
            chief justice thro' all the King's dominions,
            and goes in circuit from time to time to hear
            complaints, and determine controversies.
            <em>The King's treasurer</em> exercises the same employment,
            and has under him Alkairs, who
            are governors of towns or villages.
            That the <i>Kondi</i>, or
            <i>Viceroy</i>, goes the circuit
            with the chief justice, both to hear causes,
            and inspect into the behaviour of the <i>Alkadi</i>,
            or chief magistrate of every village in
            their several
            districts<a class="notelink" href="#NoteI_FN7"><sup>E</sup></a><a name="FootI_FN7"></a>." <i>Vasconcelas</i>,
            an author mentioned in the collection, says,
            "The ancientest are preferred to be the
            <em>Prince's counsellors</em>, who keep always
            about his person; and the men of most
            judgment and experience are the judges."
            <a name="P_10"></a><i>The Fulis</i> are settled on both sides of the
            river <i>Senegal</i>: Their country, which is very
            fruitful and populous, extends near four
            hundred miles from East to West. They are
            generally of a deep tawny complexion, appearing
            to bear some affinity with the Moors,
            whose country they join on the North.
            They are good farmers, and make great harvest
            of corn, cotton, tobacco, &amp;c. and breed
            great numbers of cattle of all kinds. <i>Bartholomew
               Stibbs</i>, (mentioned by <i>Fr. Moor</i>) in his
            account of that country says,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteI_FN8"><sup>F</sup></a><a name="FootI_FN8"></a> "<em>They were
               a cleanly, decent, industrious people, and very
               affable</em>." But the most particular account
            we have, of these people, is from <i>Francis
               Moor</i> himself, who says,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteI_FN9"><sup>G</sup></a><a name="FootI_FN9"></a> "Some of these
            Fuli blacks who dwell on both sides the
            river Gambia, are in subjection to the
            Mandingos, amongst whom they dwell,
            having been probably driven out of their
            country by war or famine. They have
            chiefs of their own, who rule with much
            moderation. Few of them will drink brandy,
            or any thing stronger than water and
            sugar, being strict Mahometans. Their
            form of government goes on easy, because
            the people are of a good quiet disposition,
            and so well instructed in what is
            <a name="P_11"></a>
            right, that a man who does ill, is the abomination
            of all, and, none will support
            him against the chief. In these countries,
            the natives are not covetous of land,
            desiring no more than what they use; and
            as they do not plough with horses and
            cattle, they can use but very little, therefore
            the Kings are willing to give the
            Fulis leave to live in their country, and
            cultivate their lands. If any of their
            people are known to be made slaves, all
            the Fulis will join to redeem them; they
            also support the old, the blind, and lame,
            amongst themselves; and as far as their
            abilities go, they supply the necessities of
            the Mandingos, great numbers of whom
            they have maintained in famine." <em>The
               author</em>, from his own observations, says,
            "They were rarely angry, and that he never
            heard them abuse one another."

         <p><i>The Mandingos</i> are said by
            <i>A. Brue</i> before
            mentioned, "To be the most numerous
            nation on the Gambia, besides which,
            numbers of them are dispersed over all
            these countries; being the most rigid Mahometans
            amongst the Negroes, they drink
            neither wine nor brandy, and are politer
            than the other Negroes. The chief of the
            trade goes through their hands. Many are
            industrious and laborious, keeping their
            ground well cultivated, and breeding a
            <a name="P_12"></a>
            good stock of cattle.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteI_FN10"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootI_FN10"></a> Every town has
            an <i>Alkadi</i>, or <i>Governor</i>,
            who has great power; for most of them having two
            common fields of clear ground, one for
            corn, and the other for rice, <i>the Alkadi</i>
            appoints the labour of all the people.
            The men work the corn ground, and
            the women and girls the rice ground;
            and as they all equally labour, so he
            equally divides the corn amongst them;
            and in case they are in want, the others
            supply them. This Alkadi decides all
            quarrels, and has the first voice in all
            conferences in town affairs." Some of
            these Mandingos who are settled at Galem,
            far up the river Senegal, can read and write
            Arabic tolerably, and are a good hospitable
            people, who carry on a trade with the inland
            nations."<a class="notelink" href="#NoteI_FN11"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootI_FN11"></a> They are extremely populous
            in those parts, their women being
            fruitful, and they not suffering any
            person amongst them, but such as are
            guilty of crimes, to be made slaves." We
            are told from Jobson,"<a class="notelink" href="#NoteI_FN12"><sup>C</sup></a><a name="FootI_FN12"></a> That the
            Mahometan Negroes say their prayers thrice a day.
            Each village has a priest who calls them to
            their duty. It is surprizing (says the author)
            as well as commendable, to see the modesty,
            <a name="P_13"></a>
            attention, and reverence they observe during
            their worship. He asked some of their
            priests the purport of their prayers and ceremonies;
            their answer always was, <em>That
               they adored God by prostrating themselves before
               him; that by humbling themselves, they
               acknowledged their own insignificancy, and
               farther intreated him to forgive their faults,
               and to grant them all good and necessary things
               as well as deliverance from evil."</em> Jobson
            takes notice of several good qualities in these
            Negroe priests, particularly their great sobriety.
            They gain their livelihood by keeping
            school for the education of the children.
            The boys are taught to read and write.
            They not only teach school, but rove about
            the country, teaching and instructing, for
            which the whole country is open to them;
            and they have a free course through all
            places, though the Kings may be at war with
            one another.

            The three fore-mentioned nations practise
            several trades, as smiths, potters, sadlers, and
            weavers. Their smiths particularly work
            neatly in gold and silver, and make knifes,
            hatchets, reaping hooks, spades and shares
            to cut iron, &amp;c. &amp;c. Their potters make
            neat tobacco pipes, and pots to boil their
            food. Some authors say that weaving is
            their principal trade; this is done by the
            women and girls, who spin and weave very
            <a name="P_14"></a>
            fine cotton cloth, which they dye blue or
            black.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteI_FN13"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootI_FN13"></a> F. Moor says, the Jalofs
            particularly make great quantities of the cotton
            cloth; their pieces are generally twenty-seven
            yards long, and about nine inches broad,
            their looms being very narrow; these they
            sew neatly together, so as to supply the use
            of broad cloth.

            It was in these parts of Guinea, that M.
            Adanson, correspondent of the Royal Academy
            of Sciences at Paris, mentioned in
            some former publications, was employed
            from the year 1749, to the year 1753, wholly
            in making <i>natural</i> and
            <i>philosophical</i> observations
            on the country about the rivers
            Senegal and Gambia. Speaking of the great
            heats in Senegal, he says,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteI_FN14"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootI_FN14"></a> "It is to them
            that they are partly indebted for the fertility
            of their lands; which is so great,
            that, with little labour and care, there
            is no fruit nor grain but grow in great
            plenty."

            Of the soil on the Gambia, he
            says,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteI_FN15"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootI_FN15"></a> "It
            is rich and deep, and amazingly fertile;
            it produces spontaneously, and almost
            without cultivation, all the necessaries of
            life, grain, fruit, herbs, and roots.
            <a name="P_15"></a>
            Every thing matures to perfection, and is
            excellent in its kind."<a class="notelink" href="#NoteI_FN16"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootI_FN16"></a> One thing,
            which always surprized him, was the prodigious
            rapidity with which the sap of trees
            repairs any loss they may happen to sustain in
            that country: "And I was never," says he,
            "more astonished, than when landing four
            days after the locusts had devoured
            all the fruits and leaves, and even the
            buds of the trees, to find the trees covered
            with new leaves, and they did not
            seem to me to have suffered much."<a class="notelink" href="#NoteI_FN17"><sup>C</sup></a><a name="FootI_FN17"></a> "It
            was then," says the same author; "the
            fish season; you might see them in shoals
            approaching towards land. Some of those
            shoals were fifty fathom square, and the
            fish crowded together in such a manner,
            as to roll upon one another, without being
            able to swim. As soon as the Negroes
            perceive them coming towards land, they
            jump into the water with a basket in one
            hand, and swim with the other. They
            need only to plunge and to lift up their
            basket, and they are sure to return loaded
            with fish." Speaking of the appearance
            of the country, and of the disposition of
            the people, he says,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteI_FN18"><sup>D</sup></a><a name="FootI_FN18"></a> "Which way
            soever I turned mine eyes on this pleasant spot,
            I beheld a perfect image of pure nature;
            <a name="P_16"></a>
            an agreeable solitude, bounded on every
            side by charming landscapes; the rural
            situation of cottages in the midst of trees;
            the ease and indolence of the Negroes,
            reclined under the shade of their spreading
            foliage; the simplicity of their dress and
            manners; the whole revived in my mind
            the idea of our first parents, and I seemed
            to contemplate the world in its primitive
            state. They are, generally speaking, very
            good-natured, sociable, and obliging. I
            was not a little pleased with this my first
            reception; it convinced me, that there
            ought to be a considerable abatement
            made in the accounts I had read and heard
            every where of the savage character of the
            Africans. I observed both in Negroes and
            Moors, great humanity and sociableness,
            which gave me strong hopes that I should
            be very safe amongst them, and meet with
            the success I desired in my enquiries after
            the curiosities of the country."<a class="notelink" href="#NoteI_FN19"><sup>E</sup></a><a name="FootI_FN19"></a> He
            was agreeably amused with the conversation
            of the Negroes, their <i>fables, dialogues</i>, and
            <i>witty stories</i> with which they entertain each
            other alternately, according to their custom.
            Speaking of the remarks which the natives
            made to him, with relation to the <i>stars</i> and
            <i>planets</i>, he says, "It is amazing, that such
            <a name="P_17"></a>
            a rude and illiterate people, should reason
            so pertinently in regard to those heavenly
            bodies; there is no manner of doubt, but
            that with proper instruments, and a good
            will, they would become <i>excellent astronomers</i>."

         <p><i>The Ivory Coast</i>; its soil and produce.
            The character of the <i>natives</i> misrepresented
            by some authors. These misrepresentations
            occasioned by <i>the Europeans</i>
            having treacherously carried off many of
            their people. <i>John Smith, surveyor to the

            and <i>Slave Coast</i>, these have the most

            number of slaves to <i>the Europeans</i>. Exceeding
            fertile. The country of <i>Axim</i>,

            The principal people have an idea
            of the true God. Commendable care of
            the poor. Several small governments depend
            on <i>plunder</i> and the

         <p>That part of Guinea known by the
            name of the <i>Grain</i>, and
            <i>Ivory Coast,</i>
            comes next in course. This coast extends
            about five hundred miles. The soil appears
            by account, to be in general fertile, producing
            abundance of rice and roots; indigo and
            cotton thrive without cultivation, and tobacco
            would be excellent, if carefully manufactured;
            they have fish in plenty; their flocks
            greatly increase, and their trees are loaded
            with fruit. They make a cotton cloth,
            which sells well on the Coast. In a word, the
            country is rich, and the commerce advantageous,
            and might be greatly augmented by
            such as would cultivate the friendship of the
            natives. These are represented by some writers
            as a rude, <em>treacherous people</em>, whilst several
            other <i>authors</i> of credit give them a very
            different character, representing them as
            <em>sensible, courteous and the fairest traders on the
               coast of Guinea</em>. In the Collection, they are
            said<a class="notelink" href="#NoteII_FN1"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootII_FN1"></a> to be averse
            to drinking to excess, and
            such as do, are severely punished by the King's
            <a name="P_19"></a>
            order: On enquiry why there is such a disagreement
            in the character given of these
            people, it appears, that though they are naturally
            inclined to be <em>kind to strangers</em>, with
            whom they are <em>fond</em> of <em>trading</em>, yet the
            <em>frequent injuries</em> done them by Europeans, have
            occasioned their being <em>suspicious and shy</em>. The
            same cause has been the occasion of the ill
            treatment they have sometimes given to innocent
            strangers, who have attempted to trade
            with them. As the Europeans have no settlement
            on this part of Guinea, the trade is
            carried on by signals from the ships, on the
            appearance of which the natives usually
            come on board in their canoes, bringing
            their gold-dust, ivory, &amp;c. which has given
            opportunity to some villainous Europeans to
            carry them off with their effects, or retain
            them on board till a ransom is paid. It is
            noted by some, that since the European voyagers
            have carried away several of these
            people, their mistrust is so great, that it is
            very difficult to prevail on them to come on
            board. <i>William Smith</i>
            remarks,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteII_FN2"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootII_FN2"></a> "As we past
            along this coast, we very often lay before
            a town, and fired a gun for the natives
            to come off, but no soul came
            near us; at length we learnt by some
            ships that were trading down the coast,
            <a name="P_20"></a>
            that the natives came seldom on board
            an English ship, for fear of being detained
            or carried off; yet last some
            ventured on board, but if those chanced
            to spy any arms, they would all immediately
            take to their canoes, and make the
            best of their way home. They had then
            in their possession one <i>Benjamin Cross</i> the
            mate of an English vessel, who was detained
            by them to make reprisals for
            some of their men, who had formerly
            been carried away by some English vessel."
            In the Collection we are told,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteII_FN3"><sup>C</sup></a><a name="FootII_FN3"></a><em>This villainous
               custom is too often practised, chiefly by the
               Bristol and Liverpool ships, and is a great detriment
               to the slave trade on the windward
               coast. John Snock, mentioned in Bosman</em><a class="notelink" href="#NoteII_FN4"><sup>D</sup></a><a name="FootII_FN4"></a> when
            on that coast, wrote, "We cast anchor, but
            not one Negro coming on board, I went on
            shore, and after having staid a while on
            the strand, some Negroes came to me; and
            being desirous to be informed why they
            did not come on board, I was answered
            that about two months before, the English
            had been there with two large vessels,
            and had ravaged the country, destroyed
            all their canoes, plundered their houses,
            and carried off some of their people, upon
            <a name="P_21"></a>
            which the remainder fled to the inland
            country, where most of them were
            that time; so that there being not much
            to be done by us, we were obliged to
            return on board.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteII_FN5"><sup>E</sup></a><a name="FootII_FN5"></a> When I enquired
            after their wars with other countries,
            they told me they were not often troubled
            with them; but if any difference happened,
            they chose rather to end the dispute
            amicably, than to come to arms."<a class="notelink" href="#NoteII_FN6"><sup>F</sup></a><a name="FootII_FN6"></a> He found the inhabitants civil and good-natured.
            Speaking of the <i>King of Rio Seftr&eacute;</i>
            lower down the coast, he says, "He was a
            very agreeable, obliging man, and that
            all his subjects are civil, as well as very
            laborious in agriculture, and the pursuits
            of trade," <i>Marchais</i>
            says,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteII_FN7"><sup>G</sup></a><a name="FootII_FN7"></a> "That
            though the country is very populous,
            yet none of the natives (except criminals)
            are sold for slaves." <i>Vaillant</i> never
            heard of any settlement being made by
            the Europeans on this part of <i>Guinea</i>; and
            <i>Smith</i>
            remarks,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteII_FN8"><sup>H</sup></a><a name="FootII_FN8"></a> "That these coasts, which
            are divided into several little kingdoms,
            and have seldom any wars, is the reason
            the slave trade is not so good here as on
            <i>the Gold and Slave Coast</i>, where the Europeans
            <a name="P_22"></a>
            have several forts and factories."
            A plain evidence this, that it is the intercourse
            with the Europeans, and their settlements
            on the coast, which gives life to the
            slave trade.

            Next adjoining to the <i>Ivory Coast</i>, are
            those called the <i>Gold Coast</i>, and the
            <i>Slave Coast</i>; authors are not agreed about
            their bounds, but their extent together along the
            coast may be about five hundred miles. And
            as the policy, produce, and oeconomy of these
            two kingdoms of Guinea are much the same,
            I shall describe them together.

         </p>
         <p>
            Here the Europeans have the greatest number
            of forts and factories, from whence, by
            means of the Negro sailors, a trade is carried
            on above seven hundred miles back
            in the inland country; whereby great numbers
            of slaves are procured, as well by means
            of the wars which arise amongst the Negroes,
            or are fomented by the Europeans, as those
            brought from the back country. Here we
            find the natives <em>more reconciled to the European
               manners and trade</em>; but, at the same
            time, <em>much more inured to war</em>, and ready to
            assist the European traders in procuring
            loadings for the great number of vessels
            which come yearly on those coasts for slaves.
            This part of Guinea is agreed by historians
            to be, in general, <em>extraordinary fruitful
               and agreeable</em>; producing (according to the
            <a name="P_23"></a>
            difference of the soil) vast quantities of rice
            and other grain; plenty of fruit and
            roots; palm wine and oil, and fish in great
            abundance, with much tame and wild cattle.
            Bosman, principal factor for the Dutch at
            D'Elmina, speaking of the country of Axim,
            which is situate towards the beginning of the
            Gold Coast, says,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteII_FN9"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootII_FN9"></a> "The Negro inhabitants
            are generally very rich, driving a
            great trade with the Europeans for gold.
            That they are industriously employed
            either in trade, fishing, or agriculture;
            but chiefly in the culture of rice, which
            grows here in an incredible abundance,
            and is transported hence all over the
            Gold Coast. The inhabitants, in lieu,
            returning full fraught with millet, jamms,
            potatoes, and palm oil." The same author
            speaking of the country of Ante, says,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteII_FN10"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootII_FN10"></a> "This country, as well as the Gold Coast,
            abounds with hills, enriched with extraordinary
            high and beautiful trees; its
            valleys, betwixt the hills, are wide and
            extensive, producing in great abundance
            very good rice, millet, jamms, potatoes,
            and other fruits, all good in their kind."
            He adds, "In short, it is a land that yields
            its manurers as plentiful a crop as they can
            wish, with great quantities of palm wine and
            <a name="P_24"></a>
            oil, besides being well furnished with all
            sorts of tame, as well as wild beasts; but
            that the last fatal wars had reduced it to
            a miserable condition, and stripped it of
            most of its inhabitants." The adjoining
            country of Fetu, he says,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteII_FN11"><sup>C</sup></a><a name="FootII_FN11"></a> "was formerly
            so powerful and populous, that it struck
            terror into all the neighbouring nations;
            but it is at present so drained by continual
            wars, that it is entirely ruined; there
            does not remain inhabitants sufficient to
            till the country, tho' it is so fruitful and
            pleasant that it may be compared to the
            country of Ante just before described;
            frequently, says that author, when walking
            through it before the last war, I have
            seen it abound with fine well built and populous
            towns, agreeably enriched with
            vast quantities of corn, cattle, palm wine,
            and oil. The inhabitants all applying
            themselves without any distinction to agriculture;
            some sow corn, others press oil,
            and draw wine from palm trees, with both
            which it is plentifully stored."

            William Smith gives much the same account
            of the before-mentioned parts of the
            Gold Coast, and adds, "The country about
            D'Elmina and Cape Coast, is much
            the same for beauty and goodness, but
            more populous; and the nearer we come
            <a name="P_25"></a>
            towards the Slave Coast, the more delightful
            and rich all the countries are,
            producing all sorts of trees, fruits, roots,
            and herbs, that grow within the Torrid
            Zone." J. Barbot also remarks,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteII_FN12"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootII_FN12"></a> with
            respect to the countries of Ante and Adom,
            "That the soil is very good and fruitful
            in corn and other produce, which it
            affords in such plenty, that besides what
            serves for their own use, they always export
            great quantities for sale; they have
            a competent number of cattle, both tame
            and wild, and the rivers abundantly stored
            with fish, so that nothing is wanting for
            the support of life, and to make it easy."
            In the Collection it is said,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteII_FN13"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootII_FN13"></a> "That the inland
            people on that part of the coast,
            employ themselves in tillage and trade,
            and supply the market with corn, fruit,
            and palm wine; the country producing
            such vast plenty of Indian corn, that abundance
            is daily exported, as well by Europeans
            as Blacks resorting thither from
            other parts." "These inland people
            are said to live in great union and friendship,
            being generally well tempered,
            civil, and tractable; not apt to shed
            human blood, except when much provoked,
            and ready to assist one another."

            whereof several are supposed to come from

            Most parts of the Slave Coasts are represented
            as equally fertile and pleasant with
            the Gold Coast. The kingdom of Whidah
            has been particularly noted by
            travellers.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteII_FN16"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootII_FN16"></a> William Smith and Bosman agree, "That
            it is one of the most delightful countries
            in the world. The great number and
            variety of tall, beautiful, and shady trees,
            which seem planted in groves, the verdant
            fields every where cultivated, and no
            otherwise divided than by those groves,
            and in some places a small foot-path, together
            with a great number of villages,
            contribute to afford the most delightful
            prospect; the whole country being a fine
            easy, and almost imperceptible ascent, for
            the space of forty or fifty miles from the sea.
            That the farther you go from the sea, the
            more beautiful and populous the country
            appears. That the natives were kind
            <a name="P_28"></a>
            and obliging, and so industrious, that no
            place which was thought fertile, could
            escape being planted, even within the hedges
            which inclose their villages. And that the
            next day after they had reaped, they sowed
            again."

            Snelgrave also says, "The country
            appears full of towns and villages; and
            being a rich soil, and well cultivated, looks
            like an entire garden." In the
            Collection,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteII_FN17"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootII_FN17"></a> the husbandry of the Negroes is described
            to be carried on with great regularity: "The
            rainy season approaching, they go into the
            fields and woods, to fix on a proper place
            for sowing; and as here is no property in
            ground, the King's licence being obtained,
            the people go out in troops, and first
            clear the ground from bushes and weeds,
            which they burn. The field thus cleared,
            they dig it up a foot deep, and so let it
            remain for eight or ten days, till the rest
            of their neighbours have disposed their
            ground in the same manner. They then
            consult about sowing, and for that end
            assemble at the King's Court the next
            Fetish day. The King's grain must be
            sown first. They then go again to the
            field, and give the ground a second
            digging, and sow their seed. Whilst
            <a name="P_29"></a>
            the King or Governor's land is sowing;
            he sends out wine and flesh ready dressed;
            enough to serve the labourers. Afterwards,
            they in like manner sow the
            ground, allotted for their neighbours, as
            diligently as that of the King's, by whom
            they are also feasted; and so continue to
            work in a body for the public benefit,
            till every man's ground is tilled and sowed.
            None but the King, and a few great men,
            are exempted from this labour. Their
            grain soon sprouts out of the ground.
            When it is about a man's height, and
            begins to ear, they raise a wooden house in
            the centre of the field, covered with straw,
            in which they set their children to watch
            their corn, and fright away the birds."

            the civility, kindness, and great industry of

            Smith,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteII_FN19"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootII_FN19"></a> who says, "The natives here seem to
            be the most gentleman-like Negroes in
            Guinea, abounding with good manners
            and ceremony to each other. The inferior
            pay the utmost deference and, respect
            to the superior, as do wives to their
            husbands, and children to their parents.
            All here are naturally industrious, and find
            constant employment; the men in agriculture,
            <a name="P_30"></a>
            and the women in spinning and
            weaving cotton. The men, whose chief
            talent lies in husbandry, are unacquainted
            with arms; otherwise, being a numerous
            people, they could have made a better
            defence against the King of Dahome, who
            subdued them without much
            trouble.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteII_FN20"><sup>C</sup></a><a name="FootII_FN20"></a> Throughout the Gold Coast, there are
            regular markets in all villages, furnished
            with provisions and merchandize, held
            every day in the week, except Tuesday,
            whence they supply not only the inhabitants,
            but the European ships. The
            <i>Negro women</i> are very expert in buying
            and selling, and extremely industrious;
            for they will repair daily to market from
            a considerable distance, loaded like pack-horses,
            with a child, perhaps, at their
            back, and a heavy burden on their heads.
            After selling their wares, they buy fish and
            other necessaries, and return home loaded
            as they came.

            of Aplogua, which is so resorted to,
            that there are usually five or six thousand
            merchants. Their markets are so well
            regulated and governed, that seldom any
            disorder happens; each species of merchandize
            <a name="P_31"></a>

            but it must be without noise or fraud.
            To keep order, the King appoints a judge,
            who, with four officers well armed, inspects
            the markets, hears all complaints, and, in a
            summary way, decides all differences; he
            has power to seize, and sell as slaves, all
            who are catched in stealing, or disturbing
            the peace. In these markets are to
            be sold men, women, children, oxen,
            sheep, goats, and fowls of all kinds; European
            cloths, linen and woollen; printed

            With respect to government, William
            Smith says,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteII_FN22"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootII_FN22"></a> "That the Gold Coast and
            Slave Coast are divided into different districts,
            some of which are governed by
            their Chiefs, or Kings; the others, being
            more of the nature of a commonwealth
            <a name="P_32"></a>
            are governed by some of the principal
            men, called Caboceros, who, Bosman says,
            are properly denominated civil fathers,
            whose province is to take care of the welfare
            of the city or village, and to appease
            tumults." But this order of government
            has been much broken since the coming of
            the Europeans. Both Bosman and Barbot
            mention <em>murther and adultery to be severely
               punished on the Coast, frequently by death; and

            The income of some of the Kings is large,
            Bosman says, "That the King of Whidah's
            revenues and duties on things bought and
            sold are considerable; he having the tithe
            of all things sold in the market, or imported

            Bosman tells us, "The Whidah Negroes
            have a faint idea of a true God, ascribing
            to him the attributes of almighty power
            and omnipresence; but God, they say, is
            too high to condescend to think of mankind;
            wherefore he commits the government
            of the world to those inferior deities
            which they worship." Some authors
            <a name="P_33"></a>
            say, the wisest of these Negroes are sensible of
            their mistake in this opinion, but dare not
            forsake their own religion, for fear of the populace
            rising and killing them. This is confirmed
            by William Smith, who says, "That
            all the natives of this coast believe there is
            one true God, the author of them and all
            things; that they have some apprehension
            of a future state; and that almost every
            village has a grove, or public place of worship,
            to which the principal inhabitants, on
            a set day, resort to make their offerings."

            in the Guinea government, "That
            however poor they may be in general,
            yet there are no beggars to be found
            amongst them; which is owing to the
            care of their chief men, whose province
            it is to take care of the welfare of the
            city or village; it being part of their office,
            to see that such people may earn their
            bread by their labour; some are set to
            blow the smith's bellows, others to press
            palm oil, or grind colours for their matts,
            and sell provision in the markets. The
            young men are listed to serve as soldiers,
            so that they suffer no common beggar."

            Bosman ascribes a further reason for this

            finds he cannot subsist, he binds himself
            for a certain sum of money, and the
            master to whom he is bound is obliged
            to find him necessaries; that the master
            sets him a sort of task, which is not in the
            least slavish, being chiefly to defend his
            master on occasions; or in sowing time to
            work as much as he himself

            Adjoining to the kingdom of Whidah, are
            several small governments, as Coto, great and
            small Popo, Ardrah, &amp;c. all situate on the
            Slave Coast, where the chief trade for slaves
            is carried on. These are governed by their
            respective Kings, and follow much the same
            customs with those of Whidah, except that
            their principal living is on plunder, and the
            slave trade.

            Next adjoining to the Slave Coast, is
            the kingdom of Benin, which, though
            it extends but about 170 miles on the sea, yet
            spreads so far inland, as to be esteemed the
            most potent kingdom in Guinea. By accounts,
            the soil and produce appear to be in
            a great measure like those before described;
            and the natives are represented as a reasonable

            this account, and says, "That the inhabitants
            are generally very good-natured,
            and exceeding courteous and civil. When
            the Europeans make them presents, which
            in their coming thither to trade they
            always do, they endeavour to return them
            doubly."

            There is in Benin a considerable order in
            government. Theft, murther, and adultery,
            being severely punished. Barbot
            says,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteIII_FN4"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootIII_FN4"></a> "If
            a man and a woman of any quality be
            surprized in adultery, they are both put to
            death, and their bodies are thrown on a
            dunghill, and left there a prey to wild
            beasts." He adds, "The severity of the
            laws in Benin against
            adultery,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteIII_FN5"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootIII_FN5"></a> amongst
            <a name="P_37"></a>
            all orders of people, deters them from
            venturing, so that it is but very seldom
            any persons are punished for that crime."
            Smith says, "Their towns are governed by
            officers appointed by the King, who have
            power to decide in civil cases, and to raise
            the public taxes; but in criminal cases,
            they must send to the King's court, which
            is held at the town of Oedo, or Great Benin.
            This town, which covers a large extent
            of ground, is about sixty mile from
            <a name="P_38"></a>
            the sea."<a class="notelink" href="#NoteIII_FN6"><sup>C</sup></a><a name="FootIII_FN6"></a> Barbot tells us, "That it contains
            thirty streets, twenty fathom wide,
            and almost two miles long, commonly,
            extending in a straight line from one gate
            to another; that the gates are guarded
            by soldiers; that in these streets markets
            are held every day, for cattle, ivory, cotton,
            and many sorts of European goods. This
            large town is divided into several wards,
            or districts, each governed by its respective
            King of a street, as they call them;
            to administer justice, and to keep good
            order. The inhabitants are very civil and
            good natured, condescending to what the
            Europeans require of them in a civil
            way." The same author confirms what
            has been said by others of their justice in
            the payment of their debts; and adds,
            "That they, above all other Guineans, are
            very honest and just in their dealings; and
            they have such an aversion for theft, that
            by the law of the country it is punished
            with death." We are told by the same
            author,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteIII_FN7"><sup>D</sup></a><a name="FootIII_FN7"></a> "That the King of Benin is
            able upon occasion to maintain an army
            of a hundred thousand men; but that,
            for the most part, he does not keep thirty
            thousand." William Smith says, "The
            <a name="P_39"></a>
            natives are all free men; none but foreigners
            can be bought and sold there.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteIII_FN8"><sup>E</sup></a><a name="FootIII_FN8"></a> They are very charitable, the King as well
            as his subjects." Bosman confirms
            this,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteIII_FN9"><sup>F</sup></a><a name="FootIII_FN9"></a> and says, "The King and great Lords subsist
            several poor at their place of residence on
            charity, employing those who are fit for
            any work, and the rest they keep for God's
            sake; so that here are no beggars."

            punishment inflicted on adulterers in this and other parts of Guinea, it
            appears the Negroes are not insensible of the sinfulness of
            such practices. How strange must it then appear to the
            serious minded amongst these people, (nay, how inconsistent
            is it with every divine and moral law amongst
            ourselves) that those christian laws which prohibit fornication
            and adultery, are in none of the English governments
            extended to them, but that they are allowed
            to cohabit and separate at pleasure? And that even their
            masters think so lightly of their marriage engagements,
            that, when it suits with their interest, they will separate
            man from wife, and children from both, to be sold into
            different, and even distant parts, without regard to their
            sometimes grievous lamentations; whence it has happened,
            that such of those people who are truly united in
            their marriage covenant, and in affection to one another,
            have been driven to such desperation, as either violently
            to destroy themselves, or gradually to pine away, and
            die with mere grief. It is amazing, that whilst the
            clergy of the established church are publicly expressing
            a concern, that these oppressed people should be made
            acquainted with the christian religion, they should be
            thus suffered, and even forced, so flagrantly to infringe
            one of the principal injunctions of our holy religion!

            The last division of Guinea from which
            slaves are imported, are the kingdoms of
            Kongo and Angola: these lie to the South
            of Benin, extending with the intermediate
            land about twelve hundred miles on the coast.
            Great numbers of the natives of both these
            kingdoms profess the christian religion, which
            was long since introduced by the Portugueze,
            who made early settlements in that country.

            In the Collection it is said, that both in

            fruitful, producing great plenty of grain,
            Indian corn, and such quantities of rice, that
            it hardly bears any price, with fruits, roots,
            and palm oil in plenty.

            The natives are generally a quiet people,
            who discover a good understanding, and
            behave in a friendly manner to strangers,
            being of a mild conversation, affable, and

            In the government of Kongo, the King

            the judges imprison and release, or impose
            fines, according to the rule of custom; but in
            weighty matters, every one may appeal to the
            King, before whom all criminal causes are
            brought, in which he giveth sentence; but
            seldom condemneth to death.

            of cloth of divers kinds, very fine and curious;
            the inhabitants are seldom idle; they
            even make needle-work caps as they walk in

            The slave trade is here principally managed

            send off from these parts fifteen thousand slaves

            His works, printed in that language

            Latin, and printed at Paris, under the
            patronage of the famous Thuanus, chancellor
            of France, with the title of <em>Geographica
               Nubiensis</em>, containing an account or all the
            nations lying on the Senegal and Gambia.
            The other wrote by John
            Leo,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteIV_FN2"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootIV_FN2"></a> a Moor,
            born at Granada, in Spain, before the
            Moors were totally expelled from that kingdom.
            He resided in Africa; but being on
            a voyage from Tripoli to Tunis, was taken
            by some Italian Corsairs, who finding him
            possessed of several Arabian books, besides
            his own manuscripts, apprehended him to be
            a man of learning, and as such presented him
            to Pope Leo the Tenth. This Pope encouraging
            him, he embraced the Romish religion,
            and his description of Africa was
            published in Italian. From these writings
            we gather, that after the Mahometan religion
            had extended to the kingdom of Morocco,
            some of the promoters of it crossing
            the sandy desarts of Numidia, which separate
            that country from Guinea, found it inhabited
            by men, who, though under no regular government,
            and destitute of that knowledge
            <a name="P_43"></a>
            the Arabians were favoured with, lived in
            content and peace. The first author particularly
            remarks, "That they never made
            war, or travelled abroad, but employed
            themselves in tending their herds, or labouring
            in the ground." J. Leo says, page
            65. "That they lived in common, having
            no property in land, no tyrant nor superior
            lord, but supported themselves in an
            equal state, upon the natural produce of
            the country, which afforded plenty of
            roots, game, and honey. That ambition
            or avarice never drove them into foreign
            countries to subdue or cheat their neighbours.
            Thus they lived without toil or
            superfluities." "The antient inhabitants
            of Morocco, who wore coats of mail,
            and used swords and spears headed with
            iron, coming amongst these harmless and
            naked people, soon brought them under
            subjection, and divided that part of Guinea
            which lies on the rivers Senegal and Gambia
            into fifteen parts; those were the fifteen
            kingdoms of the Negroes, over which
            the Moors presided, and the common people
            were Negroes. These Moors taught
            the Negroes the Mahometan religion, and
            arts of life; particularly the use of iron,
            before unknown to them. About the 14th
            century, a native Negro, called Heli Ischia,
            expelled the Moorish conquerors; but tho'
            <a name="P_44"></a>
            the Negroes threw off the yoke of a foreign
            nation, they only changed a Libyan for a
            Negroe master. Heli Ischia himself becoming
            King, led the Negroes on to foreign
            wars, and established himself in power over
            a very large extent of country." Since
            Leo's time, the Europeans have had very little
            knowledge of those parts of Africa, nor do
            they know what became of his great empire.
            It is highly probable that it broke into pieces,
            and that the natives again resumed many of
            their antient customs; for in the account
            published by William Moor, in his travels
            on the river Gambia, we find a mixture of
            the Moorish and Mahometan customs, joined
            with the original simplicity of the Negroes.
            It appears by accounts of antient voyages,
            collected by Hackluit, Purchas, and others,
            that it was about fifty years before the discovery
            of America, that the Portugueze attempted
            to sail round Cape Bojador, which lies
            between their country and Guinea; this, after
            divers repulses occasioned by the violent
            currents, they effected; when landing on the
            western coasts of Africa, they soon began to
            make incursions into the country, and to seize
            and carry off the native inhabitants. As
            early as the year 1434, Alonzo Gonzales,
            the first who is recorded to have met with
            the natives, being on that coast, pursued
            <a name="P_45"></a>
            and attacked a number of them, when some
            were wounded, as was also one of the Portugueze;
            which the author records as the
            first blood spilt by christians in those parts.
            Six years after, the same Gonzales again attacked
            the natives, and took twelve prisoners,
            with whom he returned to his vessels;
            he afterwards put a woman on shore, in
            order to induce the natives to redeem the
            prisoners; but the next day 150 of the
            inhabitants appeared on horses and camels,
            provoking the Portugueze to land; which
            they not daring to venture, the natives discharged
            a volley of stones at them, and
            went off. After this, the Portugueze still
            continued to send vessels on the coast of
            Africa; particularly we read of their falling
            on a village, whence the inhabitants fled, and,
            being pursued, twenty-five were taken: "<em>He
               that ran best</em>," says the author, "<em>taking the
               most</em>. In their way home they killed some
            of the natives, and took fifty-five more
            prisoners.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteIV_FN3"><sup>C</sup></a><a name="FootIV_FN3"></a> Afterwards Dinisanes Dagrama,
            with two other vessels, landed on the
            island Arguin, where they took fifty-four
            Moors; then running along the coast eighty
            leagues farther, they at several times took
            fifty slaves; but here seven of the Portugueze
            were killed. Then being joined by
            several other vessels, Dinisanes proposed to
            <a name="P_46"></a>
            destroy the island, to revenge the loss of
            the seven Portugueze; of which the Moors
            being apprized, fled, so that no more than
            twelve were found, whereof only four
            could be taken, the rest being killed, as
            also one of the Portugueze." Many more
            captures of this kind on the coast of Barbary
            and Guinea, are recorded to have been made
            in those early times by the Portugueze; who,
            in the year 1481, erected their first fort at
            D'Elmina on that coast, from whence they
            soon opened a trade for slaves with the inland
            parts of Guinea.

            From the foregoing accounts, it is undoubted,
            that the practice of making slaves
            of the Negroes, owes its origin to the early
            incursions of the Portugueze on the coast of
            Africa, solely from an inordinate desire of
            gain. This is clearly evidenced from their
            own historians, particularly <i>Cada Mosto</i>,
            about the year 1455, who
            writes,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteIV_FN4"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootIV_FN4"></a> "That before the trade was settled for purchasing
            slaves from the Moors at Arguin,
            sometimes four, and sometimes more Portugueze
            vessels, were used to come to that
            gulph, well armed; and landing by night,
            would surprize some fishermen's villages:
            that they even entered into the country,
            and carried off Arabs of both sexes, whom
            they sold in Portugal." And also, "That
            <a name="P_47"></a>
            the Portugueze and Spaniards, settled on
            four of the Canary islands, would go to
            the other island by night, and seize some
            of the natives of both sexes, whom they
            sent to be sold in Spain."

            After the settlement of America, those devastations,
            and the captivating the miserable
            Africans, greatly increased.

         </p>
         <p>
            Anderson, in his history of trade and commerce,
            at page 336, speaking of what passed
            in the year 1508, writes, "That the Spaniards
            had by this time found that the miserable
            Indian natives, whom they had
            made to work in their mines and fields,
            were not so robust and proper for those
            purposes as Negroes brought from Africa;
            wherefore they, about that time, began to
            import Negroes for that end into Hispaniola,
            from the Portugueze settlements on
            the Guinea coasts; and also afterwards for
            their sugar works." This oppression of
            the Indians had, even before this time, rouzed
            the zeal, as well as it did the compassion, of
            some of the truly pious of that day; particularly
            that of Bartholomew De las Casas,
            bishop of Chapia; whom a desire of being
            instrumental towards the conversion of the
            Indians, had invited into America. It is generally
            agreed by the writers of that age,
            that he was a man of perfect disinterestedness,
            and ardent charity; being affected with this
            <a name="P_48"></a>
            sad spectacle, he returned to the court of
            Spain, and there made a true report of the
            matter; but not without being strongly opposed
            by those mercenary wretches, who
            had enslaved the Indians; yet being strong
            and indefatigable, he went to and fro between
            Europe and America, firmly determined
            not to give over his pursuit but with
            his life. After long solicitation, and innumerable
            repulses, he obtained leave to lay
            the matter before the Emperor Charles
            the Fifth, then King of Spain. As the contents
            of the speech he made before the King
            in council, are very applicable to the case of
            the enslaved Africans, and a lively evidence
            that the spirit of true piety speaks the same
            language in the hearts of faithful men in
            all ages, for the relief of their fellow creatures
            from oppression of every kind, I think
            it may not be improper here to transcribe
            the most interesting parts of it. "I was,"
            says this pious bishop, "one of the first who
            went to America; neither curiosity nor
            interest prompted me to undertake so
            long and dangerous a voyage; the saving
            the souls of the heathen was my sole object.
            Why was I not permitted, even at
            the expence of my blood, to ransom so
            many thousand souls, who fell unhappy
            victims to avarice or lust? I have been
            an eye witness to such cruel treatment of
            <a name="P_49"></a>
            the Indians, as is too horrid to be mentioned
            at this time.&#8212;It is said that barbarous
            executions were necessary to punish
            or check the rebellion of the Americans;&#8212;but
            to whom was this owing?
            Did not those people receive the Spaniards,
            who first came amongst them, with gentleness
            and humanity? Did they not shew
            more joy, in proportion, in lavishing
            treasure upon them, than the Spaniards
            did greediness in receiving it?&#8212;But our
            avarice was not yet satisfied;&#8212;tho' they
            gave up to us their land and their riches,
            we would tear from them their wives, their
            children and their liberties.&#8212;To blacken
            these unhappy people, their enemies
            assert, that they are scarce human creatures?&#8212;but
            it is we that ought to blush,
            for having been less men, and more barbarous,
            than they.&#8212;What right have
            we to enslave a people who are born free,
            and whom we disturbed, tho' they never
            offended us?&#8212;They are represented as
            a stupid people, addicted to vice?&#8212;but
            have they not contracted most of their
            vices from the example of the christians?
            And as to those vices peculiar to themselves,
            have not the christians quickly exceeded
            them therein? Nevertheless it
            must be granted, that the Indians still remain
            untainted with many vices usual amongst
            <a name="P_50"></a>
            the Europeans; such as ambition,
            blasphemy, treachery, and many like
            monsters, which have not yet took place
            with them; they have scarce an idea of
            them; so that in effect, all the advantage
            we can claim, is to have more elevated
            notions of things, and our natural faculties
            more unfolded and more cultivated
            than theirs.&#8212;Do not let us flatter our
            corruptions, nor voluntarily blind ourselves;
            <em>all</em> nations are equally <em>free</em>; one
            nation has no right to infringe upon the
            freedom of any other; let us do towards
            these people as we would have them to
            have done towards us, if they had landed
            upon our shore, with the same superiority
            of strength. And indeed, why
            should not things be equal on both sides?
            How long has the right of the strongest
            been allowed to be the balance of justice?
            What part of the gospel gives a sanction
            to such a doctrine? In what part of the
            whole earth did the apostles and the first
            promulgators of the gospel ever claim a
            right over the lives, the freedom, or the substance
            of the Gentiles? What a strange method
            this is of propagating the gospel, that
            holy law of grace, which, from being, slaves
            to Satan, initiates us into the freedom of
            the children of God!&#8212;Will it be possible
            for us to inspire them with a love to
            <a name="P_51"></a>
            its dictates, while they are so exasperated
            at being dispossessed of that invaluable
            blessing, <em>Liberty?</em> The apostles submitted
            to chains themselves, but loaded no man
            with them. Christ came to free, not to
            enslave us.&#8212;Submission to the faith
            he left us, ought to be a voluntary act,
            and should be propagated by persuasion,
            gentleness, and reason."

            "At my first arrival in Hispaniola, (added
            the bishop) it contained a million of
            inhabitants; and now (viz. in the space
            of about twenty years) there remains scarce
            the hundredth part of them; thousands
            have perished thro' want, fatigue, merciless
            punishment, cruelty, and barbarity.
            If the blood of <em>one</em> man unjustly shed,
            calls loudly for vengeance; how strong
            must be the cry of that of so <em>many</em> unhappy
            creatures which is shedding daily?"&#8212;The
            good bishop concluded his speech, with
            imploring the King's clemency for subjects
            so unjustly oppressed; and bravely declared,
            that heaven would one day call him to an
            account, for the numberless acts of cruelty
            which he might have prevented. The King
            applauded the bishop's zeal; promised to
            second it; but so many of the great ones
            had an interest in continuing the oppression,
            that nothing was done; so that all the Indians
            in Hispaniola, except a few who

            It was about the year 1551, towards the
            latter end of the reign of King Edward
            the Sixth, when some London merchants
            sent out the first English ship, on a trading
            voyage to the coast of Guinea; this was soon
            followed by several others to the same parts;
            <a name="P_53"></a>
            but the English not having then any plantations
            in the West Indies, and consequently
            no occasion for Negroes, such ships traded
            only for gold, elephants teeth, and Guinea
            pepper. This trade was carried on at the
            hazard of losing their ships and cargoes, if
            they had fallen into the hands of the Portuguese,
            who claimed an exclusive right of
            trade, on account of the several settlements
            they had made there.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteV_FN1"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootV_FN1"></a> In the year 1553, we
            find captain Thomas Windham trading along
            the coast with 140 men, in three ships, and
            sailing as far as Benin, which lies about
            3000 miles down the coast, to take in a load
            of pepper.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteV_FN2"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootV_FN2"></a> Next year John Lock traded along
            the coast of Guinea, as far as D'Elmina,
            when he brought away considerable quantities
            of gold and ivory. He speaks well of the natives, and
            says,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteV_FN3"><sup>C</sup></a><a name="FootV_FN3"></a> "<em>That
               whoever will deal with them must behave civilly, for
               they will not traffic if ill used</em>." In 1555,
            William Towerson traded in a peaceable
            manner with the natives, who made complaint
            to him of the Portuguese, who were
            then settled in their castle at D'Elmina, saying,
            "<em>They were bad men, who made them
               slaves if they could take them, putting irons
               on their legs</em>."

            This bad example of the Portuguese was
            soon followed by some evil disposed Englishmen;
            for the same captain Towerson
            relates,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteV_FN4"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootV_FN4"></a> "That in the course of his voyage, he
            perceived the natives, near D'Elmina, unwilling
            to come to him, and that he was
            at last attacked by them; which he understood
            was done in revenge for the
            wrong done them the year before, by
            one captain Gainsh, who had taken away
            the Negro captain's son, and three others,
            with their gold, &amp;c. This caused them to
            join the Portuguese, notwithstanding
            their hatred of them, against the English."
            The next year captain Towerson
            brought these men back again; whereupon the Negroes shewed him much
            kindness.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteV_FN5"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootV_FN5"></a> Quickly
            after this, another instance of the
            same kind occurred, in the case of captain
            George Fenner, who being on the coast,
            with three vessels, was also attacked by the
            Negroes, who wounded several of his people,
            and violently carried three of his men
            to their town. The captain sent a messenger,
            offering any thing they desired for the
            ransom of his men: but they refused to deliver
            them, letting him know, "<em>That
               three weeks before, an English ship, which
               <a name="P_55"></a>
               came in the road, had carried off three of
               their people; and that till they were brought
               again, they would not restore his men, even tho'
               they should give their three ships to release
               them</em>." It was probably the evil conduct
            of these, and some other Englishmen, which
            was the occasion of what is mentioned in
            Hill's naval history, viz. "That when captain
            Hawkins returned from his first voyage
            to Africa, Queen Elizabeth sent for
            him, when she expressed her concern,
            lest any of the African Negroes should
            be carried off without their free consent;
            which she declared would be detestable,
            and would call down the vengeance of
            heaven upon the undertakers." Hawkins
            made great promises, which nevertheless he
            did not perform; for his next voyage to the
            coast appears to have been principally calculated
            to procure Negro slaves, in order
            to sell them to the Spaniards in the West Indies;
            which occasioned the same author to
            use these remarkable words: "<em>Here began
               the horrid practice of forcing the Africans into
               slavery: an injustice and barbarity, which,
               so sure as there is vengeance in heaven for
               the worst of crimes, will some time be the destruction
               of all who act or who encourage it</em>."
            This captain Hawkins, afterwards sir John
            Hawkins, seems to have been the first Englishman
            who gave public countenance to this
            <a name="P_56"></a>
            wicked traffic: For Anderson, before mentioned,
            at page 401, says, "That in the
            year 1562, captain Hawkins, assisted by
            subscription of sundry gentlemen, now
            fitted out three ships; and having learnt
            that Negroes were a very good commodity
            in Hispaniola, he sailed to the coast of
            Guinea, took in Negroes, and sailed with
            them for Hispaniola, where he sold them,
            and his English commodities, and loaded
            his three vessels with hides, sugar and
            ginger, &amp;c. with which he returned
            home anno 1563, making a prosperous
            voyage." As it proved a lucrative business,
            the trade was continued both by
            Hawkins and others, as appears from the naval
            chronicle, page 55, where it is said,
            "That on the 18th of October, 1564, captain
            John Hawkins, with two ships of 700
            and 140 tuns, sailed for Africa; that on
            the 8th of December they anchored to the
            South of Cape Verd, where the captain
            manned the boat, and sent eighty men in
            armour into the country, to see if they
            could take some Negroes; but the natives
            flying from them, they returned to their
            ships, and proceeded farther down the
            coast. Here they staid certain days, sending
            their men ashore, in order (as the author
            says) to burn and spoil their towns
            and take the inhabitants. The land they
            <a name="P_57"></a>
            observed to be well cultivated, there being
            plenty of grain, and fruit of several
            sorts, and the towns prettily laid out. On
            the 25th, being informed by the Portugueze
            of a town of Negroes called Bymba,
            where there was not only a quantity of
            gold, but an hundred and forty inhabitants,
            they resolved to attack it, having the Portugueze
            for their guide; but by mismanagement
            they took but ten Negroes, having
            seven of their own men killed, and
            twenty-seven wounded. They then went
            farther down the coast; when, having procured
            a number of Negroes, they proceeded
            to the West Indies, where they sold them to
            the Spaniards." And in the same naval
            chronicle, at page 76, it is said, "That in the
            year 1567, Francis Drake, before performing
            his voyage round the world, went with
            Sir John Hawkins in his expedition to the
            coast of Guinea, where taking in a cargo
            of slaves, they determined to steer for the
            Caribbee islands." How Queen Elizabeth
            suffered so grievous an infringement of the
            rights of mankind to be perpetrated by her
            subjects, and how she was persuaded, about
            the 30th year of her reign, to grant patents
            for carrying on a trade from the North part
            of the river Senegal, to an hundred leagues
            beyond Sierra Leona, which gave rise to the
            present African company, is hard to account
            <a name="P_58"></a>
            for, any otherwise than that it arose from
            the misrepresentation made to her of the situation
            of the Negroes, and of the advantages
            it was pretended they would reap from
            being made acquainted with the christian
            religion. This was the case of Lewis the
            XIIIth, King of France, who, Labat, in his
            account of the isles of America, tells us,
            "Was extremely uneasy at a law by which
            the Negroes of his colonies were to be
            made slaves; but it being strongly urged
            to him as the readiest means for their
            conversion to christianity, he acquiesced
            therewith." Nevertheless, some of the
            christian powers did not so easily give way
            in this matter; for we find,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteV_FN6"><sup>C</sup></a><a name="FootV_FN6"></a> "That cardinal
            Cibo, one of the Pope's principal ministers
            of state, wrote a letter on behalf
            of the college of cardinals, or great council
            at Rome, to the missionaries in Congo,
            complaining that the pernicious and abominable
            abuse of selling slaves was yet continued,
            requiring them to remedy the
            same, if possible; but this the missionaries
            saw little hopes of accomplishing, by reason
            that the trade of the country lay wholly in
            slaves and ivory."

            From the foregoing accounts, as well as
            other authentic publications of this kind, it
            appears that it was the unwarrantable lust of
            <a name="P_59"></a>
            gain, which first stimulated the Portugueze,
            and afterwards other Europeans, to engage
            in this horrid traffic. By the most authentic
            relations of those early times, the natives
            were an inoffensive people, who, when civilly
            used, traded amicably with the Europeans.
            It is recorded of those of Benin, the largest
            kingdom in Guinea,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteV_FN7"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootV_FN7"></a><em>That they were a
               gentle, loving people</em>; and Reynold
            says,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteV_FN8"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootV_FN8"></a> "<em>They found more sincere proofs of love and
               good will from the natives, than they could
               find from the Spaniards and Portugueze, even
               tho' they had relieved them from the greatest
               misery</em>." And from the same relations
            there is no reason to think otherwise, but
            that they generally lived in peace amongst
            themselves; for I don't find, in the numerous
            publications I have perused on this subject,
            relating to these early times, of there
            being wars on that coast, nor of any sale of captives
            taken in battle, who would have been
            otherwise sacrificed by the
            victors:<a class="notelink" href="#NoteV_FN9"><sup>C</sup></a><a name="FootV_FN9"></a> Notwithstanding
            <a name="P_60"></a>
            some modern authors, in their
            publications relating to the West Indies,
            desirous of throwing a veil over the iniquity
            of the slave trade, have been hardy enough,
            upon meer supposition or report, to assert the
            contrary.

         <p><a name="NoteV_FN9"></a><a href="#FootV_FN9">C</a>: Note, This plea falls of itself,
            for if the Negroes
            apprehended they should be cruelly put to death, if
            they were not sent away, why do they manifest such
            reluctance and dread as they generally do, at being
            brought from their native country? William Smith, at
            page 28, says, "<em>The Gambians abhor slavery, and will
               attempt any thing, tho' never so desperate, to avoid it</em>," and
            Thomas Philips, in his account of a voyage he performed
            to the coast of Guinea, writes, "<em>They, the Negroes,
               are so loth to leave their own country, that they have often
               leaped out of the canoe, boat, or ship, into the sea, and kept
               under water till they were drowned, to avoid being
               taken up</em>."

            It was long after the Portugueze had
            made a practice of violently forcing the natives
            of Africa into slavery, that we read of
            the different Negroe nations making war
            upon each other, and selling their captives.
            And probably this was not the case, till
            those bordering on the coast, who had been
            used to supply the vessels with necessaries,
            had become corrupted by their intercourse
            with the Europeans, and were excited by
            drunkenness and avarice to join them in
            carrying on those wicked schemes, by which
            those unnatural wars were perpetrated;
            the inhabitants kept in continual alarms;
            the country laid waste; and, as William Moor
            expresses it, <em>Infinite numbers sold into slavery</em>.
            But that the Europeans are the principal cause
            of these devastations, is particularly evidenced
            by one, whose connexion with the trade
            <a name="P_61"></a>
            would rather induce him to represent it in
            the fairest colours, to wit, William Smith,
            the person sent in the year 1726 by the
            African company to survey their settlements,
            who, from the information he received of
            one of the factors, who had resided ten
            years in that country, says,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteV_FN10"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootV_FN10"></a> "<em>That the discerning
               natives account it their greatest unhappiness,

               Europeans."&#8212;"That we christians introduced

            In the accounts relating to the African
            trade, we find this melancholy truth
            farther asserted by some of the principal
            directors in the different factories; particularly
            A. Brue says,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteV_FN11"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootV_FN11"></a> "<em>That the Europeans were
               far from desiring to act as peace-makers
               amongst the Negroes; which would be acting
               contrary to their interest, since the greater the
               wars, the more slaves were procured</em>," And
            William Bosman also remarks,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteV_FN12"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootV_FN12"></a> "That one
            of the former commanders <em>gave large sums
               of money to the Negroes of one nation, to induce
               them to attack some of the neighbouring nations,
               which occasioned a battle which was
               more bloody than the wars of the Negroes usually
               <a name="P_62"></a>
               are</em>." This is confirmed by J. Barbot,
            who says, "<em>That the country of D'Elmina,
               which was formerly very powerful and populous,
               was in his time so much drained of its
               inhabitants by the intestine wars fomented
               amongst the Negroes by the Dutch, that there
               did not remain inhabitants enough to till the
               country</em>."

            The conduct of the Europeans
            and Africans compared. Slavery more tolerable
            amongst the antients than in our
            colonies. As christianity prevailed amongst
            the barbarous nations, the inconsistency
            of slavery became more apparent. The
            charters of manumission, granted in the
            early times of christianity, founded on an
            apprehension of duty to God. The antient
            Britons, and other European nations,
            in their original state, no less barbarous
            than the Negroes. Slaves in Guinea used
            with much greater lenity than the Negroes
            are in the colonies.&#8212;Note. How the

            Such is the woeful corruption of human
            nature, that every practice which flatters
            our pride and covetousness, will find its
            advocates! This is manifestly the case in the
            matter before us; the savageness of the
            Negroes in some of their customs, and particularly
            their deviating so far from the feelings
            of humanity, as to join in captivating
            <a name="P_64"></a>
            and selling each other, gives their interested
            oppressors a pretence for representing them
            as unworthy of liberty, and the natural
            rights of mankind. But these sophisters
            turn the argument full upon themselves,
            when they instigate the poor creatures to
            such shocking impiety, by every means that
            fantastic subtilty can suggest; thereby shewing
            in their own conduct, a more glaring
            proof of the same depravity, and, if there
            was any reason in the argument, a greater
            unfitness for the same precious enjoyment:
            for though some of the ignorant Africans
            may be thus corrupted by their intercourse
            with the baser of the European natives, and
            the use of strong liquors, this is no excuse
            for high-professing christians; bred in a
            civilized country, with so many advantages
            unknown to the Africans, and pretending
            to a superior degree of gospel light. Nor
            can it justify them in raising up fortunes to
            themselves from the misery of others,
            and calmly projecting voyages for the seizure
            of men naturally as free as themselves;
            and who, they know, are no otherwise to
            be procured than by such barbarous means,
            as none but those hardened wretches, who are
            lost to every sense of christian compassion,
            can make use of. Let us diligently compare,
            and impartially weigh, the situation of those
            ignorant Negroes, and these enlightened
            <a name="P_65"></a>
            christians; then lift up the scale and say,
            which of the two are the greater savages.

            Slavery has been of a long time in practice
            in many parts of Asia; it was also in
            usage among the Romans when that empire
            flourished; but, except in some particular
            instances, it was rather a reasonable servitude,
            no ways comparable to the unreasonable and
            unnatural service extorted from the Negroes
            in our colonies. A late learned
            author,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteVI_FN1"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootVI_FN1"></a> speaking of those times which succeeded
            the dissolution of that empire, acquaints us,
            that as christianity prevailed, it very much
            removed those wrong prejudices and practices,
            which had taken root in darker
            times: after the irruption of the Northern
            nations, and the introduction of the feudal
            or military government, whereby the
            most extensive power was lodged in a few
            members of society, to the depression of the
            rest, the common people were little better
            than slaves, and many were indeed such;
            but as christianity gained ground, the gentle
            spirit of that religion, together with the doctrines
            it teaches, concerning the original
            equality of mankind, as well as the impartial
            eye with which the Almighty regards
            men of every condition, and admits them to
            a participation of his benefits; so far manifested
            <a name="P_66"></a>
            the inconsistency of slavery with christianity,
            that to set their fellow christians at
            liberty was deemed an act of piety, highly
            meritorious and acceptable to
            God.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteVI_FN2"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootVI_FN2"></a> Accordingly
            <a name="P_67"></a>
            a great part of the charters
            granted for the manumission or freedom of
            slaves about that time, are granted <i>pro amore
               Dei, for the love of God, pro mercede animae,
               to obtain mercy to the soul</i>. Manumission was
            frequently granted on death-beds, or by
            latter wills. As the minds of men are at that
            time awakened to sentiments of humanity
            and piety, these deeds proceeded from religious
            motives. The same author remarks,
            That there are several forms of those manumissions
            still extant, all of them founded <em>on
               religious considerations</em>, and <em>in order to procure
               the favour of God</em>. Since that time, the practice
            of keeping men in slavery gradually
            ceased amongst christians, till it was renewed
            in the case before us. And as the prevalency
            of the spirit of christianity caused men to
            emerge from the darkness they then lay
            under, in this respect; so it is much to be
            feared that so great a deviation therefrom,
            by the encouragement given to the slavery
            of the Negroes in our colonies, if continued,
            will, by degrees, reduce those countries which
            support and encourage it but more immediately
            <a name="P_68"></a>
            those parts of America which are in
            the practice of it, to the ignorance and barbarity
            of the darkest ages.

         <p><a name="NoteVI_FN2"></a><a href="#FootVI_FN2">B</a>: In the years 1315 and 1318, Louis X.
            and his brother Philip, Kings of France, issued ordonnances,
            declaring, "That as all men were by nature free-born,
            and as their kingdom was called the kingdom
            of Franks, they determined that it should be so in
            reality, as well as in name; therefore they appointed
            that enfranchisements should be granted throughout
            the whole kingdom, upon just and reasonable
            conditions." "These edicts were carried into immediate
            execution within the royal domain."&#8212;"In England, as the spirit of liberty
            gained ground, the very name and idea of personal servitude, without
            any formal interposition of the legislature to prohibit
            it, was totally banished."

         </p>
         <p>
            "The effects of such a remarkable change in the
            condition of so great a part of the people, could not
            fail of being considerable and extensive. The husbandman,
            master of his own industry, and secure of
            reaping for himself the fruits of his labour, became
            farmer of the same field where he had formerly
            been compelled to toil for the benefit of another. The
            odious name of master and of slave, the most mortifying
            and depressing of all distinctions to human
            nature, were abolished. New prospects opened,
            and new incitements to ingenuity and enterprise
            presented themselves, to those who were emancipated.
            The expectation of bettering their fortune, as
            well as that of raising themselves to a more honourable
            condition, concurred in calling forth their
            activity and genius; and a numerous class of men,
            who formerly had no political existence, and were
            employed merely as instruments of labour, became
            useful citizens, and contributed towards augmenting
            the force or riches of the society, which adopted
            them as members." William Robertson's history

            If instead of making slaves of the Negroes,
            the nations who assume the name and character
            of christians, would use their endeavours
            to make the nations of Africa acquainted
            with the nature of the christian
            religion, to give them a better sense of the
            true use of the blessings of life, the more
            beneficial arts and customs would, by degrees,
            be introduced amongst them; this
            care probably would produce the same effect
            upon them, which it has had on the inhabitants
            of Europe, formerly as savage
            and barbarous as the natives of Africa.
            Those cruel wars amongst the blacks would
            be likely to cease, and a fair and honorable
            commerce, in time, take place
            throughout that vast country. It was by
            these means that the inhabitants of Europe,
            though formerly a barbarous people,
            became civilized. Indeed the account Julius
            Caesar gives of the ancient Britons in
            their state of ignorance, is not such as should
            make us proud of ourselves, or lead us to
            despise the unpolished nations of the earth;
            for he informs us, "That they lived in many
            respects like our Indians, being clad with
            skins, painting their bodies, &amp;c." He
            also adds, "That they, brother with brother,
            <a name="P_69"></a>
            and parents with children, had wives in
            common." A greater barbarity than any
            heard of amongst the Negroes. Nor doth
            Tacitus give a more honourable account of
            the Germans, from whom the Saxons, our
            immediate ancestors, sprung. The Danes,
            who succeeded them (who may also be numbered
            among our progenitors) were full as
            bad, if not worse.

         </p>
         <p>
            It is usual for people to advance as a palliation
            in favour of keeping the Negroes in
            bondage, that there are slaves in Guinea, and
            that those amongst us might be so in their
            own country; but let such consider the inconsistency
            of our giving any countenance
            to slavery, because the Africans, whom we
            esteem a barbarous and savage people, allow
            of it, and perhaps the more from our example.
            Had the professors of christianity acted indeed
            as such, they might have been instrumental
            to convince the Negroes of their error
            in this respect; but even this, when
            inquired into, will be to us an occasion of
            blushing, if we are not hardened to every
            sense of shame, rather than a <em>palliation</em>
            of our iniquitous conduct; as it will appear
            that the slavery endured in Guinea, and
            other parts of Africa, and in Asia,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteVI_FN3"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootVI_FN3"></a> is by
            <a name="P_70"></a>
            no means so grievous as that in our colonies.
            William Moor, speaking of the natives
            <a name="P_71"></a>
            living on the river Gambia,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteVI_FN4"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootVI_FN4"></a> says, "Tho'
            some of the Negroes have many house
            slaves, which are their greatest glory;
            that those slaves live so well and easy,
            that it is sometimes a hard matter to
            know the slaves from their masters or
            mistresses. And that though in some
            parts of Africa they sell their slaves born
            in the family, yet on the river Gambia
            they think it a very wicked thing."
            The author adds, "He never heard of but
            one that ever sold a family slave, except
            for such crimes as they would have been
            sold for if they had been free." And in
            Astley's collection, speaking of the customs of
            the Negroes in that large extent of country
            <a name="P_72"></a>
            further down the coast, particularly denominated
            the coast of Guinea, it is
            said,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteVI_FN5"><sup>C</sup></a><a name="FootVI_FN5"></a> "They have not many slaves on the coast; none
            but the King or nobles are permitted to
            buy or sell any; so that they are allowed
            only what are necessary for their families,
            or tilling the ground." The same author
            adds, "<em>That they generally use their slaves well,
               and seldom correct them</em>."

            history of the piratical states of Barbary, printed in 1750,
            <em>said to be</em> wrote by a person who resided
            at Algiers, in a public character, at page 265 the
            author says, "The world exclaims against the Algerines
            for their cruel treatment of their slaves, and
            their employing even tortures to convert them to
            mahometism: but this is a vulgar error, artfully
            propagated for selfish views. So far are their slaves
            from being ill used, that they must have committed
            some very great fault to suffer any punishment.
            Neither are they forced to work beyond their
            strength, but rather spared, lest they should fall sick.
            Some are so pleased with their situation, that they
            will not purchase their ransom, though they are
            able." It is the same generally through the Mahometan
            countries, except in some particular instances,
            as that of Muley Ishmael, late Emperor of Morocco,
            who being naturally barbarous, frequently used
            both his subjects and slaves with cruelty. Yet
            even under him the usage the slaves met with was,
            in general, much more tolerable than that of the Negroe
            slaves in the West Indies. Captain Braithwaite,
            an author of credit, who accompanied consul general
            Russel in a congratulatory ambassy to Muley Ishmael's
            successor, upon his accession to the throne, says, "The
            situation of the christian slaves in Morocco
            was not near so bad as represented.&#8212;That it was
            true they were kept at labour by the late Emperor,
            but not harder than our daily labourers go through.&#8212;Masters of ships
            were never obliged to work, nor
            such as had but a small matter of money to give
            the Alcaide.&#8212;When sick, they had a religious house
            appointed for them to go to, where they were well
            attended: and whatever money in charity was
            sent them by their friends in Europe, was their
            own." Braithwaite's revolutions of Morocco.

            cannot forbear applauding the humanity of the
            Turks to these creatures; they are not ill used; and
            their slavery, in my opinion, is no worse than servitude
            all over the world. It is true they have no

            value than our salaries to our ordinary servants."

         </p>
         <p>
            That celebrated civilian Montesquieu,
            in his treatise <em>on the spirit of laws</em>, on
            the article of slavery says, "<em>It is neither
               <a name="P_73"></a>
               useful to the master nor slave; to the slave,
               because he can do nothing through principle
               (or virtue); to the master, because he contracts
               with his slave all sorts of bad habits,
               insensibly accustoms himself to want all
               moral virtues; becomes haughty, hasty, hard-hearted,
               passionate, voluptuous, and cruel</em>."
            The lamentable truth of this assertion was
            quickly verified in the English plantations.
            When the practice of slave-keeping was introduced,
            it soon produced its natural
            effects; it reconciled men, of otherwise good
            dispositions, to the most hard and cruel
            measures. It quickly proved, what, under
            the law of Moses, was apprehended would
            be the consequence of unmerciful chastisements.
            Deut. xxv. 2. "<em>And it shall be if
               the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that
               the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to
               be beaten before his face, according to his
               fault, by a certain number; forty stripes he
               may give him, and not exceed</em>." And the
            reason rendered, is out of respect to human
            nature, viz. "<em>Lest if he should exceed, and
               beat him above these with many stripes, then
               thy brother should seem vile unto thee</em>." As
            this effect soon followed the cause, the cruelest
            measures were adopted, in order to make
            the most of the poor <em>wretches</em> labour; and in
            the minds of the masters such an idea was
            excited of inferiority, in the nature of these
            <a name="P_74"></a>
            their unhappy fellow creatures, that they
            soon esteemed and treated them as beasts of
            burden: pretending to doubt, and some
            of them even presuming to deny, that the
            efficacy of the death of Christ extended to
            them. Which is particularly noted in a
            book, intitled <em>The Negroes and Indians advocate</em>,
            dedicated to the then Archbishop of
            Canterbury, wrote so long since as in the
            year 1680, by Morgan Godwyn, thought to
            be a clergyman of the church of
            England.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteVII_FN1"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootVII_FN1"></a> The same spirit of
            sympathy and zeal which
            <a name="P_75"></a>
            stirred up the good Bishop of Chapia to
            plead with so much energy the kindred cause
            <a name="P_76"></a>
            of the Indians of America, an hundred and
            fifty years before, was equally operating
            about a century past on the minds of some of
            the well disposed of that day; amongst others
            this worthy clergyman, having been an eye
            witness of the oppression and cruelty exercised
            upon the Negro and Indian slaves,
            endeavoured to raise the attention of those,
            in whose power it might be to procure them
            relief; amongst other matters, in his address
            to the Archbishop, he remarks in substance,
            "That the people of the island of Barbadoes
            were not content with exercising the
            greatest hardness and barbarity upon the
            Negroes, in making the most of their
            labour, without any regard to the calls of
            humanity, but that they had suffered such
            a slight and undervaluement to prevail in
            their minds towards these their oppressed
            fellow creatures, as to discourage any step
            being taken, whereby they might be made
            acquainted with the christian religion.
            That their conduct towards their slaves
            was such as gave him reason to believe,
            that either they had suffered a spirit of
            infidelity, a spirit quite contrary to the
            nature of the gospel, to prevail in them,
            or that it must be their established opinion
            that the Negroes had no more souls than
            beasts; that hence they concluded them
            to be neither susceptible of religious impressions,
            <a name="P_77"></a>
            nor fit objects for the redeeming
            grace of God to operate upon. That
            under this persuasion, and from a disposition
            of cruelty, they treated them
            with far less humanity than they did
            their cattle; for, says he, they do not
            starve their horses, which they expect
            should both carry and credit them on the
            road; nor pinch the cow, by whose milk
            they are sustained; which yet, to their
            eternal shame, is too frequently the lot and
            condition of those poor people, from whose
            labour their wealth and livelihood doth
            wholly arise; not only in their diet, but in
            their cloathing, and overworking some of
            them even to death (which is particularly
            the calamity of the most innocent and laborious)
            but also in tormenting and whipping
            them almost, and sometimes quite, to
            death, upon even small miscarriages. He
            apprehends it was from this prejudice
            against the Negroes, that arose those supercilious
            checks and frowns he frequently
            met with, when using innocent arguments
            and persuasions, in the way of his
            duty as a minister of the gospel, to labour
            for the convincement and conversion of
            the Negroes; being repeatedly told, with
            spiteful scoffings, (even by some esteemed
            religious) that the Negroes were no
            more susceptible of receiving benefit, by
            <a name="P_78"></a>
            becoming members of the church, than
            their dogs and bitches. The usual answer
            he received, when exhorting their masters
            to do their duty in that respect, being,
            <em>What! these black dogs be made christians!
               what! they be made like us! with abundance
               more of the same</em>. Nevertheless, he remarks
            that the Negroes were capable,
            not only of being taught to read and
            write, &amp;c. but divers of them eminent in
            the management of business. He declares
            them to have an equal right with
            us to the merits of Christ; of which if
            through neglect or avarice they are deprived,
            that judgment which was denounced
            against wicked Ahab, must
            befal us: <em>Our life shall go for theirs</em>. The
            loss of their souls will be required at our
            hands, to whom God hath given so blessed
            an opportunity of being instrumental to
            their salvation."

         <p><a name="NoteVII_FN1"></a><a href="#FootVII_FN1">A</a>: "There is a principle which is
            pure, placed in the human mind, which in different places or ages hath
            had different names; it is, however, pure, and proceeds
            from God.&#8212;It is deep and inward, confined to
            no forms of religion, nor excluded from any, where
            the heart stands in perfect sincerity. In whomsoever
            this takes root and grows, of what nation soever, they
            become brethren in the best sense of the expression.
            Using ourselves to take ways which appear most easy
            to us, when inconsistent with that purity which is
            without beginning, we thereby set up a government of
            our own, and deny obedience to Him whose service is
            true liberty. He that has a servant, made so wrongfully,
            and knows it to be so, when he treats him otherwise
            than a free man, when he reaps the benefit of his
            labour, without paying him such wages as are reasonably
            due to free men for the like service; these things,
            though done in calmness, without any shew of disorder,
            do yet deprave the mind, in like manner, and with
            as great certainty, as prevailing cold congeals water.
            These steps taken by masters, and their conduct striking
            the minds of their children, whilst young, leave
            less room for that which is good to work upon them.
            The customs of their parents, their neighbours, and the
            people with whom they converse, working upon their
            minds, and they from thence conceiving wrong ideas
            of things, and modes of conduct, the entrance into
            their hearts becomes in a great measure shut up against
            the gentle movings of uncreated purity.

            "From one age to another the gloom grows thicker
            and darker, till error gets established by general opinion;
            but whoever attends to perfect goodness, and remains
            under the melting influence of it, finds a path
            unknown to many, and sees the necessity to lean
            upon the arm of divine strength, and dwell alone, or
            with a few in the right, committing their cause to
            him who is a refuge to his people. Negroes are our
            fellow creatures, and their present condition among
            us requires our serious consideration. We know not
            the time, when those scales, in which mountains are
            weighed, may turn. The parent of mankind is gracious,
            his care is over his smallest creatures, and a multitude
            of men escape not his notice; and though many
            of them are trodden down and despised, yet he remembers

            the spreading increasing exaltation of the oppressor.
            He turns the channel of power, humbles the most
            haughty people, and gives deliverance to the oppressed,
            at such periods as are consistent with his infinite justice

            that degree that wickedness takes root and spreads

            real cause for sorrow, to all such whose love to mankind
            stands on a true principle, and wisely consider the

            He complains, "That they were suffered
            to live with their women in no
            better way than direct fornication; no
            care being taken to oblige them to continue
            together when married; but that
            they were suffered at their will to leave
            their wives, and take to other women." I
            shall conclude this sympathizing clergyman's
            observations, with an instance he
            gives, to shew, "that not only discouragements
            <a name="P_79"></a>
            and scoffs at that time
            prevailed in Barbadoes, to establish an
            opinion that the Negroes were not capable
            of religious impressions, but that even
            violence and great abuses were used to
            prevent any thing of the kind taking
            place. It was in the case of a poor Negro,
            who having, at his own request, prevailed
            on a clergyman to administer baptism
            to him, on his return home the brutish
            overseer took him to task, giving him to
            understand, that that was no sunday's
            work for those of his complexion; that he
            had other business for him, the neglect
            whereof would cost him an afternoon's
            baptism in blood, as he in the morning
            had received a baptism with water, (these,
            says the clergyman, were his own words)
            which he accordingly made good; of
            which the Negro complained to him,
            and he to the governor; nevertheless,
            the poor miserable creature was ever after
            so unmercifully treated by that inhuman
            wretch, the overseer, that, to avoid
            his cruelty, betaking himself to the woods,
            he there perished." This instance is applicable
            to none but the cruel perpetrator;
            and yet it is an instance of what, in a greater
            or less degree, may frequently happen, when
            those poor wretches are left to the will of
            such brutish inconsiderate creatures as those
            <a name="P_80"></a>
            overseers often are. This is confirmed in
            a <em>History of Jamaica</em>, wrote in thirteen letters,
            about the year 1740, by a person then
            residing in that island, who writes as
            follows, "I shall not now enter upon the
            question, whether the slavery of the Negroes
            be agreeable to the laws of nature
            or not; though it seems extremely hard
            they should be reduced to serve and toil
            for the benefit of others, without the least
            advantage to themselves. Happy Britannia,
            where slavery is never known! where liberty
            and freedom chears every misfortune.
            Here (<em>says the author</em>) we can boast of no
            such blessing; we have at least ten slaves
            to one freeman. I incline to touch the
            hardships which these poor creatures
            suffer, in the tenderest manner, from
            a particular regard which I have to
            many of their masters, but I cannot conceal
            their sad circumstances intirely: the
            most trivial error is punished with terrible
            whipping. I have seen some of them
            treated in that cruel manner, for no other
            reason but to satisfy the brutish pleasure
            of an overseer, who has their punishment
            mostly at his discretion. I have seen their
            bodies all in a gore of blood, the skin
            torn off their backs with the cruel whip;
            beaten pepper and salt rubbed in the
            wounds, and a large stick of sealing wax
            <a name="P_81"></a>
            dropped leisurely upon them. It is no
            wonder, if the horrid pain of such inhuman
            tortures incline them to rebel. Most
            of these slaves are brought from the coast
            of Guinea. When they first arrive, it is
            observed, they are simple and very innocent
            creatures; but soon turn to be
            roguish enough. And when they come to
            be whipt, urge the example of the whites
            for an excuse of their faults."

         </p>
         <p>
            These accounts of the deep depravity of
            mind attendant on the practice of slavery,
            verify the truth of Montesquieu's remark of
            its pernicious effects. And altho' the same
            degree of opposition to instructing the Negroes
            may not now appear in the islands as
            formerly, especially since the Society appointed
            for propagating the Gospel have
            possessed a number of Negroes in one of them;
            nevertheless the situation of these oppressed
            people is yet dreadful, as well to themselves
            as in its consequence to their hard task-masters,
            and their offspring, as must be evident
            to every impartial person who is acquainted
            with the treatment they generally receive,
            or with the laws which from time to time
            have been made in the colonies, with respect
            to the Negroes; some of them being absolutely
            inconsistent with reason, and shocking to
            humanity. By the 329th act of the assembly
            of Barbadoes, page 125, it is enacted,

         </p><a name="P_82"></a><p>
            "That if any Negroe or other slave under
            punishment by his master, or his order,
            for running away, or any other
            crime or misdemeanors towards his said
            master, unfortunately shall suffer in life
            or member, (which seldom happens) no
            person whatsoever shall be liable to any
            fine therefore. But if any man shall, <em>of
               wantonness, or only of bloody-mindedness or
               cruel intention, wilfully kill a Negroe, or other
               slave of his own, he shall pay into the public
               treasury, fifteen pounds sterling</em>." Now that
            the life of a man should be so lightly valued,
            as that fifteen pounds should be judged a
            sufficient indemnification of the murder of
            one, even when it is avowedly done <em>wilfully,
               wantonly, cruelly, or of bloody-mindedness</em>,
            is a tyranny hardly to be paralleled: nevertheless
            human laws cannot make void the
            righteous law of God, or prevent the inquisition
            of that awful judgment day, when,
            "<em>at the hand of every man's brother the life of
               man shall be required</em>." By the law of
            South Carolina, the person that killeth a
            Negroe is only subject to a fine, or twelve
            months imprisonment. It is the same in
            most, if not all the West-Indies. And by an
            act of the assembly of Virginia, (4 Ann. Ch.
            49. sect. 27. p. 227.) after proclamation is
            issued against slaves, "that run away and
            lie out, <em>it is lawful for any person whatsoever
               <a name="P_83"></a>
               to kill and destroy such slaves, by such
               ways and means as he, she, or they shall
               think fit, without accusation or impeachment
               of any crime for the same</em>."&#8212;And lest private
            interest should incline the planter to
            mercy, it is provided, "<em>That every slave so
               killed, in pursuance of this act, shall be paid
               for by the public</em>."

         </p>
         <p>
            It was doubtless a like sense of sympathy
            with that expressed by Morgan Godwyn
            before mentioned, for the oppressed Negroes,
            and like zeal for the cause of religion, so manifestly
            trampled upon in the case of the
            Negroes, which induced Richard Baxter, an
            eminent preacher amongst the Dissenters in
            the last century, in his <em>christian directory</em>, to
            express himself as follows, viz. "Do you
            mark how God hath followed you with
            plagues; and may not conscience tell you,
            that it is for your inhumanity to the souls
            and bodies of men?"&#8212;"To go as pirates;
            and catch up poor Negroes, or people
            of another land, that never forfeited life
            or liberty, and to make them slaves, and
            sell them, is one of the worst kinds of
            thievery in the world; and such persons
            are to be taken for the common enemies
            of mankind; and they that buy them and
            use them as beasts for their mere commodity,
            and betray, or destroy, or neglect their
            <a name="P_84"></a>
            souls, are fitter to be called devils incarnate
            than christians: It is an heinous sin to buy
            them, unless it be in charity to deliver
            them. Undoubtedly they are presently
            bound to deliver them, because by right
            the man is his own, therefore no man else
            can have a just title to him."

         </p>
         <p>
            We are told by Griffith Hughes, rector
            of St. Lucy in Barbadoes, in his
            natural history of that island, printed in
            the year 1750, "That there were between
            sixty-five and seventy thousand Negroes,
            at that time, in the island, tho' formerly
            they had a greater number. That in order
            to keep up a necessary number, they
            were obliged to have a yearly supply from
            Africa. That the hard labour, and often
            <a name="P_86"></a>
            want of necessaries, which these unhappy
            creatures are obliged to undergo, destroy
            a greater number than are bred there." He
            adds, "That the capacities of their minds
            in common affairs of life are but little inferior,
            if at all, to those of the Europeans.
            If they fail in some arts, he says, it may
            be owing more to their want of education,
            and the depression of their spirits by slavery,
            than to any want of natural abilities."
            This destruction of the human
            species, thro' unnatural hardships, and want
            of necessary supplies, in the case of the Negroes,
            is farther confirmed in <em>an account of
               the European settlements in America</em>, printed
            London, 1757, where it is said, par. 6. chap.
            11th, "The Negroes in our colonies endure
            a slavery more compleat, and attended
            with far worse circumstances, than
            what any people in their condition suffer
            in any other part of the world,
            or have suffered in any other period of
            time: Proofs of this are not wanting.
            The prodigious waste which we experience
            in this unhappy part of our species, is a
            full and melancholy evidence of this
            truth. The island of Barbadoes, (the Negroes
            upon which do not amount to eighty
            thousand) notwithstanding all the
            means which they use to increase them
            by propagation, and that the climate is
            <a name="P_87"></a>
            in every respect (except that of being
            more wholesome) exactly resembling the
            climate from whence they come; notwithstanding
            all this, Barbadoes lies under
            a necessity of an annual recruit of five
            thousand slaves, to keep up the stock at
            the number I have mentioned. This prodigious
            failure, which is at least in the
            same proportion in all our islands, shews
            demonstratively that some uncommon and
            unsupportable hardship lies upon the Negroes,
            which wears them down in such a
            surprising manner."

         </p>
         <p>
            In an account of part of North America,
            published by Thomas Jeffery, 1761, the author,
            speaking of the usage the Negroes receive
            in the West India islands, says, "It is
            impossible for a human heart to reflect upon
            the servitude of these dregs of mankind,
            without in some measure feeling for
            their misery, which ends but with their
            lives.&#8212;Nothing can be more wretched
            than the condition of this people. One
            would imagine, they were framed to be
            the disgrace of the human species; banished
            from their country, and deprived of
            that blessing, liberty, on which all other
            nations set the greatest value, they are in
            a measure reduced to the condition of
            beasts of burden. In general, a few roots,
            potatoes especially, are their food, and
            <a name="P_88"></a>
            two rags, which neither screen them from
            the heat of the day, nor the extraordinary
            coolness of the night, all their covering;
            their sleep very short; their labour almost
            continual; they receive no wages, but
            have twenty lashes for the smallest fault."
            <em>A thoughtful</em> person, who had an opportunity
            of observing the miserable condition of
            the Negroes in one of our West India
            islands, writes thus, "I met with daily exercise
            to see the treatment which those miserable
            wretches met with from their
            masters; with but few exceptions. They
            whip them most unmercifully on small
            occasions: you will see their bodies all
            whealed and scarred; in short, they seem
            to set no other value on their lives, than
            as they cost them so much money; and are
            restrained from killing them, when angry,
            by no worthier consideration, than that
            they lose so much. They act as though they
            did not look upon them as a race of human
            creatures, who have reason, and remembrance
            of misfortunes, but as beasts;
            like oxen, who are stubborn, hardy, and
            senseless, fit for burdens, and designed to
            bear them: they won't allow them to
            have any claim to human privileges, or
            scarce indeed to be regarded as the work
            of God. Though it was consistent with
            the justice of our Maker to pronounce
            <a name="P_89"></a>
            the sentence on our common parent,
            and through him on all succeeding generations,
            <em>That he and they should eat their
               bread by the sweat of their brows</em>: yet does
            it not stand recorded by the same eternal
            truth, <em>That the labourer is worthy of his
               hire?</em> It cannot be allowed, in natural
            justice, that there should be a servitude
            without condition; a cruel, endless
            servitude. It cannot be reconcileable to
            natural justice, that whole nations, nay,
            whole continents of men, should be devoted
            to do the drudgery of life for others,
            be dragged away from their attachments
            of relations and societies, and be made to
            serve the appetite and pleasure of a race
            of men, whose superiority has been obtained
            by illegal force."

         <p>
            Sir Hans Sloane, in the introduction to his
            natural history of Jamaica, in the account he
            gives of the treatment the Negroes met with
            there, speaking of the punishments inflicted
            on them, says, page 56. "For rebellion, the
            punishment is burning them, by nailing
            them down to the ground with crooked
            sticks on every limb, and then applying
            the fire, by degrees, from the feet and
            hands, burning them gradually up to the
            head, whereby <em>their pains are extravagant</em>.
            For crimes of a less nature, gelding
            or chopping off half the foot with an axe.&#8212;For
            <a name="P_90"></a>
            negligence, they are usually
            whipped by the overseers with lance-wood
            switches.&#8212;After they are whipped
            till they are raw, some put on their skins
            pepper and salt, to make them smart; at
            other times, their masters will drop melted
            wax on their skins, and use several <em>very
               exquisite torments</em>." In that island, the
            owners of the Negroe slaves set aside to
            each a parcel of ground, and allow them half
            a day at the latter end of the week, which,
            with the day appointed by the divine injunction
            to be a day of rest and service to
            God, and which ought to be kept as such,
            is the only time allowed them to manure
            their ground. This, with a few herrings,
            or other salt fish, is what is given for their
            support. Their allowance for cloathing in
            the island, is seldom more than six yards of
            oznabrigs each year. And in the more
            northern colonies, where the piercing westerly
            winds are long and sensibly felt, these
            poor Africans suffer much for want of sufficient
            cloathing; indeed some have none till
            they are able to pay for it by their labour.
            The time that the Negroes work in the
            West Indies, is from day-break till noon;
            then again from two o'clock till dark (during
            which time, they are attended by overseers,
            who severely scourge those who appear
            to them dilatory); and before they are suffered
            <a name="P_91"></a>
            to go to their quarters, they have still
            something to do, as collecting herbage for
            the horses, gathering fuel for the boilers,
            &amp;c. so that it is often past twelve before they
            can get home, when they have scarce time
            to grind and boil their Indian corn; whereby,
            if their food was not prepared the evening
            before, it sometimes happens that they
            are called again to labour before they can
            satisfy their hunger. And here no delay or
            excuse will avail; for if they are not in the
            field immediately upon the usual notice,
            they must expect to feel the overseer's lash.
            In crop time (which lasts many months) they
            are obliged, by turns, to work most of the
            night in the boiling house. Thus their
            owners, from a desire of making the greatest
            gain by the labour of their slaves, lay heavy
            burdens on them, and yet feed and cloath
            them very sparingly, and some scarce feed or
            cloath them at all; so that the poor creatures
            are obliged to shift for their living in the best
            manner they can, which occasions their
            being often killed in the neighbouring lands,
            stealing potatoes, or other food, to satisfy
            their hunger. And if they take any thing
            from the plantation they belong to, though
            under such pressing want, their owners will
            correct them severely for taking a little of
            what they have so hardly laboured for;
            whilst many of themselves riot in the greatest
            <a name="P_92"></a>
            luxury and excess. It is matter of astonishment
            how a people, who, as a nation, are
            looked upon as generous and humane, and
            so much value themselves for their uncommon
            sense of the benefit of liberty, can live
            in the practice of such extreme oppression
            and inhumanity, without seeing the inconsistency
            of such conduct, and feeling great
            remorse. Nor is it less amazing to hear these
            men calmly making calculations about the
            strength and lives of their fellow men. In
            Jamaica, if six in ten of the new imported
            Negroes survive the seasoning, it is looked
            upon as a gaining purchase. And in most
            of the other plantations, if the Negroes live
            eight or nine years, their labour is reckoned
            a sufficient compensation for their cost. If
            calculations of this sort were made upon the
            strength and labour of beasts of burden, it
            would not appear so strange; but even then,
            a merciful man would certainly use his beast
            with more mercy than is usually shewn to
            the poor Negroes. Will not the groans, the
            dying groans, of this deeply afflicted and oppressed
            people reach heaven? and when the
            cup of iniquity is full, must not the inevitable
            consequence be, the pouring forth of the
            judgments of God upon their oppressors?
            But alas! is it not too manifest that this oppression
            has already long been the object of
            the divine displeasure? For what heavier
            <a name="P_93"></a>
            judgment, what greater calamity, can befal
            any people, than to become subject to that
            hardness of heart, that forgetfulness of God,
            and insensibility to every religious impression,
            as well as that general depravation of
            manners, which so much prevails in these
            colonies, in proportion as they have more
            or less enriched themselves at the expence of
            the blood and bondage of the Negroes.

         </p>
         <p>
            It is a dreadful consideration, as a late
            author remarks, that out of the stock of
            eighty thousand Negroes in Barbadoes, there
            die every year five thousand more than are
            born in that island; which failure is probably
            in the same proportion in the other islands.
            <em>In effect, this people is under a necessity of being
               entirely renewed every sixteen years.</em> And
            what must we think of the management of
            a people, who, far from increasing greatly,
            as those who have no loss by war ought to
            do, must, in so short a time as sixteen years,
            without foreign recruits, be entirely consumed
            to a man! Is it not a christian doctrine,
            <em>that the labourer is worthy of his hire?</em>
            And hath not the Lord, by the mouth of his
            prophet, pronounced, <em>"Wo unto that man
               who buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and
               his chambers by wrong; who uses his neighbour's
               service without wages, and giveth him nought
               for his work?"</em> And yet the poor Negro
            slaves are constrained, like the beasts, by
            <a name="P_94"></a>
            beating, to work hard without hire or recompence,
            and receive nothing from the hand
            of their unmerciful masters, but such a
            wretched provision as will scarce support
            them under their fatigues. The intolerable
            hardships many of the slaves undergo, are sufficiently
            proved by the shortness of their lives.&#8212;And who
            are these miserable creatures,
            that receive such barbarous treatment
            from the planter? Can we restrain our
            just indignation, when we consider that they
            are undoubtedly <em>his brethren! his neighbours!
               the children of the same Father, and some
               of those for whom Christ died, as truly as for the
               planter himself</em>. Let the opulent planter, or
            merchant, prove that his Negro slave is not
            his brother, or that he is not his neighbour,
            in the scripture sense of these appellations;
            and if he is not able so to do, how will he
            justify the buying and selling of his brethren,
            as if they were of no more consideration
            than his cattle? The wearing them out
            with continual labour, before they have
            lived out half their days? The severe whipping
            and torturing them, even to death, if
            they resist his unsupportable tyranny? Let
            the hardiest slave-holder look forward to
            that tremendous day, when he must give
            an account to God of his stewardship; and
            let him seriously consider, whether, at such a
            time, he thinks he shall be able to satisfy

            or the fate of war, or the birth of children
            in his house, plantation, or territories, or
            any other circumstance whatever, can give
            him such an absolute property in the persons
            of men, as will justify his retaining them as
            slaves, and treating them as beasts? Let him
            diligently consider whether there will not
            always remain to the slave a <em>superior</em> property
            or right to the fruit of his own labour;
            and more especially to his own person; that
            being which was given him by God, and
            which none but the Giver can justly claim?

            The advantage which would
            have accrued to the natives of Guinea, if
            the Europeans had acted towards them
            agreeable to the dictates of humanity
            and christianity. <em>An inordinate</em> desire of
            gain in the Europeans, the true occasion
            of the slave trade. Notice of the misrepresentations
            of the Negroes by most authors,
            in order to palliate the iniquity of
            the slave trade. Those misrepresentations

         <p>
            From the foregoing accounts of the
            natural disposition of the Negroes, and
            the fruitfulness of most parts of Guinea,
            which are confirmed by authors of candour,
            who have wrote from their own
            knowledge, it may well be concluded, that
            the Negroes acquaintance with the Europeans
            might have been a happiness to them,
            if these last had not only bore the name,
            but had also acted the part, of Christians, and
            used their endeavours by example, as well as
            precept, to make them acquainted with the
            <a name="P_97"></a>
            glad tidings of the gospel, which breathes
            peace and good will to man, and with that
            change of heart, that redemption from sin,
            which christianity proposeth; innocence
            and love might then have prevailed, nothing
            would have been wanting to complete the
            happiness of the simple Africans: but the
            reverse has happened; the Europeans, forgetful
            of their duty as men and christians,
            have conducted themselves in so iniquitous a
            manner, as must necessarily raise in the
            minds of the thoughtful and well-disposed
            Negroes, the utmost scorn and detestation
            of the very name of christians. All other
            considerations have given way to an infallible
            desire of gain, which has been the
            principal and moving cause of the most <em>iniquitous
               and dreadful scene</em> that was, perhaps,
            ever acted upon the face of the earth; instead
            of making use of that superior knowledge
            with which the Almighty, the common
            Parent of mankind, had favoured them, to
            strengthen the principle of peace and good
            will in the breasts of the incautious Negroes,
            the Europeans have, by their bad example,
            led them into excess of drunkenness, debauchery,
            and avarice; whereby every passion
            of corrupt nature being inflamed, they have
            been easily prevailed upon to make war, and
            captivate one another; as well to furnish
            means for the excesses they had been habituated
            <a name="P_98"></a>
            to, as to satisfy the greedy desire of
            gain in their profligate employers, who to
            this intent have furnished them with prodigious
            quantities of arms and ammunition.
            Thus they have been hurried into confusion,
            distress, and all the extremities of temporal
            misery; every thing, even the power of
            their Kings, has been made subservient to
            this wicked purpose; for instead of being
            protectors of their subjects, some of those
            rulers, corrupted by the excessive love of
            spirituous liquors, and the tempting baits
            laid before them by the factors, have invaded
            the liberties of their unhappy subjects, and
            are become their oppressors.

         </p>
         <p>
            Here it may be necessary to observe, that
            the accounts we have of the inhabitants of
            Guinea, are chiefly given by persons engaged
            in the trade, who, from self-interested views,
            have described them in such colours as
            were least likely to excite compassion and
            respect, and endeavoured to reconcile so
            manifest a violation of the rights of mankind
            to the minds of the purchasers; yet they
            cannot but allow the Negroes to be possessed
            of some good qualities, though they contrive
            as much as possible to cast a shade over them.
            A particular instance of this appears in Astley's
            collection, vol. 2. p. 73, where the author,
            speaking of the Mandingos settled at
            Galem, which is situated 900 miles up the
            <a name="P_99"></a>
            Senegal, after saying that they carry on a
            commerce to all the neighbouring kingdoms, and
            amass riches, adds, "That excepting
            <em>the vices peculiar to the Blacks</em>, they
            are a good sort of people, honest, hospitable,
            just to their word, laborious, industrious,
            and very ready to learn arts and
            sciences." Here it is difficult to imagine
            what vices can be peculiarly attendant on a
            people so well disposed as the author describes
            these to be. With respect to the
            charge some authors have brought against
            them, as being void of all natural affection,
            it is frequently contradicted by others. In
            vol. 2. of the Collection, p. 275, and 629,
            the Negroes of North Guinea, and the
            Gold Coast, are said <em>to be fond of their children,
               whom they love with tenderness</em>. And
            Bosman says, p. 340, "Not a few in his
            country (viz. Holland) fondly imagine,
            that parents here sell their children, men
            their wives, and one brother the other:
            but those who think so deceive themselves;
            for this never happens on any
            other account but that of necessity, or
            some great crime." The same is repeated
            by J. Barbot, page 326, and also confirmed
            by Sir Hans Sloane, in the introduction to his
            natural history of Jamaica; where speaking
            of the Negroes, he says, "They are usually
            thought to be haters of their own
            <a name="P_100"></a>
            children, and therefore it is believed that
            they sell and dispose of them to strangers
            for money: but this is not true; for the
            Negroes of Guinea being divided into
            several captainships, as well as the Indians
            of America, have wars; and besides those
            slain in battle, many prisoners are taken,
            who are sold as slaves, and brought thither:
            but the parents here, although their children
            are slaves for ever, yet have so great
            love for them, that no master dares sell,
            or give away, one of their little ones,
            unless they care not whether their parents
            hang themselves or no." J. Barbot,
            speaking of the occasion of the natives of
            Guinea being represented as a treacherous
            people, ascribes it to the Hollanders (and
            doubtless other Europeans) usurping authority,
            and fomenting divisions between the
            Negroes. At page 110, he says, "It is well
            known that many of the European nations
            trading amongst these people, have very
            unjustly and inhumanly, without any
            provocation, stolen away, from time to
            time, abundance of the people, not only
            on this coast, but almost every where in
            Guinea, who have come on board their
            ships in a harmless and confiding manner:
            these they have in great numbers carried
            away, and sold in the plantations, with
            other slaves which they had purchased."
            <a name="P_101"></a>
            And although some of the Negroes may be
            justly charged with indolence and supineness,
            yet many others are frequently mentioned
            by authors <em>as a careful, industrious, and even
               laborious</em> people. But nothing shews more
            clearly how unsafe it is to form a judgment
            of distant people from the accounts given
            of them by travellers, who have taken but
            a transient view of things, than the case of
            the Hottentots, viz. those several nations of
            Negroes who inhabit the most southern part
            of Africa: <em>these people</em> are represented by
            several authors, who appear to have very
            much copied their relations one from the
            other, as so savage and barbarous as to have
            little of human, but the shape: but these
            accounts are strongly contradicted by others,
            particularly Peter Kolben, who has given a circumstantial
            relation of the disposition and
            manners of those people.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteIX_FN1"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootIX_FN1"></a> He was a man
            of learning, sent from the court of Prussia
            solely to make astronomical and natural observations
            there; and having no interest in the
            slavery of the Negroes, had not the same
            inducement as most other relators had, to
            misrepresent the natives of Africa. He resided
            eight years at and about the Cape of
            Good Hope, during which time he examined
            with great care into the customs, manners,
            <a name="P_102"></a>
            and opinions of the Hottentots; whence he
            sets these people in a quite different light
            from what they appeared in former authors,
            whom he corrects, and blames for the falsehoods
            they have wantonly told of them. At
            p. 61, he says, "The details we have in several
            authors, are for the most part made up
            of inventions and hearsays, which generally
            prove false." Nevertheless, he allows
            they are justly to be blamed for their sloth.&#8212;<em>The
               love of liberty and indolence is their all;
               compulsion is death to them. While necessity obliges
               them to work, they are very tractable, obedient,
               and faithful; but when they have got enough
               to satisfy the present want, they are deaf to all
               further intreaty</em>. He also faults them for
            their nastiness, the effect of sloth; and for
            their love of drink, and the practice of
            some unnatural customs, which long use has
            established amongst them; which, nevertheless,
            from the general good disposition of
            these people, there is great reason to believe
            they might be persuaded to refrain from,
            if a truly christian care had been extended
            towards them. He says, "They are
            eminently distinguished by many virtues,
            as their mutual benevolence, friendship,
            and hospitality; they breathe kindness
            and good will to one another, and seek
            all opportunities of obliging. Is a Hottentot's
            <a name="P_103"></a>
            assistance required by one of his
            countrymen? he runs to give it. Is his advice
            asked? he gives it with sincerity. Is
            his countryman in want? he relieves him to
            the utmost of his power." Their hospitality
            extends even to European strangers: in travelling
            thro' the Cape countries, you meet with
            a chearful and open reception, in whatsoever
            village you come to. In short, he says,
            page 339, "The integrity of the Hottentots,
            their strictness and celerity in the
            execution of justice, and their charity, are
            equalled by few nations. <em>In alliances, their
               word is sacred; there being hardly any thing
               they look upon as a fouler crime than breach
               of engagements. Theft and adultery they
               punish with death</em>." They firmly believe
            there is a God, the author of all things,
            whom they call the God of gods; but it
            does not appear that they have an institution
            of worship directly regarding this supreme
            Deity. When pressed on this article, they
            excuse themselves by a tradition, "<em>That
               their first parents so grievously offended
               this great God, that he cursed them and their
               posterity with hardness of heart; so that
               they know little about him, and have less inclination
               to serve him</em>." As has been already
            remarked, these Hottentots are the
            only Negroe nations bordering on the sea,
            we read of, who are not concerned in making
            <a name="P_104"></a>
            or keeping slaves. Those slaves made
            use of by the Hollanders at the Cape, are
            brought from other parts of Guinea. Numbers
            of these people told the author, "That
            the vices they saw prevail amongst christians;
            their avarice, their envy and hatred
            of one another; their restless discontented
            tempers; their lasciviousness and
            injustice, were the things that principally
            kept the Hottentots from hearkening to
            christianity."

            Man-stealing esteemed highly
            criminal, and punishable by the laws of
            Guinea: <em>No</em> Negroes allowed to be sold
            for slaves there, but those deemed prisoners
            of war, or in punishment for crimes.
            <em>Some</em> of the Negroe rulers, corrupted by
            the Europeans, violently infringe the laws
            of Guinea. The King of Barsailay noted
            in that respect.

         </p>
         <p>
            By an inquiry into the laws and customs
            formerly in use, and still in force
            amongst the Negroes, particularly on the
            Gold Coast, it will be found, that provision
            was made for the general peace, and for the
            safety of individuals; even in W. Bosman's
            time, long after the Europeans had established
            the slave-trade, the natives were not publicly
            enslaved, any otherwise than in punishment for
            crimes, when prisoners of war,
            or by a violent exertion of the power of
            their corrupted Kings. Where any of the
            natives were stolen, in order to be sold to
            the Europeans, it was done secretly, or at
            least, only connived at by those in power:
            <a name="P_106"></a>
            this appears From Barbot and Bosman's account
            of the matter, both agreeing that
            man-stealing was not allowed on the
            Gold Coast. The first<a class="notelink" href="#NoteX_FN1"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootX_FN1"></a> says, "<em>Kidnapping
               or stealing of human creatures is punished
               there, and even sometimes with death.</em>"
            And, W. Bosman, whose long residence on
            the coast, enabled him to speak with certainty,
            says,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteX_FN2"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootX_FN2"></a> "<em>That the laws were severe
               against murder, thievery, and adultery.</em>"
            And adds, "<em>That man-stealing was
               punished on the Gold Coast with rigid
               severity and sometimes with death itself.</em>"
            Hence it may be concluded, that the sale
            of the greatest part of the Negroes to the
            Europeans is supported by violence, in defiance
            of the laws, through the knavery of
            their principal men,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteX_FN3"><sup>C</sup></a><a name="FootX_FN3"></a> who, (as is too often
            the case with those in European countries)
            under pretence of encouraging trade, and
            increasing the public revenue, disregard the
            dictates of justice, and trample upon those
            liberties which they are appointed to preserve.

            is in a more peculiar manner the business of Kings, rich

            Fr. Moor also mentions man-stealing as
            being discountenanced by the Negroe Governments
            <a name="P_107"></a>
            on the river Gambia, and speaks
            of the inslaving the peaceable inhabitants,
            as a violence which only happens under
            a corrupt administration of justice;
            he says,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteX_FN4"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootX_FN4"></a> "The Kings
            of that country generally advise with their head men,
            scarcely doing any thing of consequence,
            without consulting them first, except
            the King of Barsailay, who being subject
            to hard drinking, is very absolute. It is
            to this King's insatiable thirst for brandy,
            that his subjects freedoms and families
            are in so precarious a situation.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteX_FN5"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootX_FN5"></a> Whenever this King wants goods or
            brandy, he sends a messenger to the English
            Governor at James Fort, to desire he
            would send a sloop there with a cargo:
            <em>this news, being not at all unwelcome</em>, the
            Governor sends accordingly; against the
            arrival of the sloop, the King goes and
            ransacks some of his enemies towns,
            seizing the people, and selling them for
            such commodities as he is in want of,
            which commonly are brandy, guns, powder,
            balls, pistols, and cutlasses, for his attendants
            and soldiers; and coral and silver
            for his wives and concubines. In case
            he is not at war with any neighbouring
            King, he then falls upon one of his own
            towns, which are numerous, and uses
            them in the same manner." "He often
            <a name="P_108"></a>
            goes with some of his troops by a town in
            the day time, and returning in the night,
            sets fire to three parts of it, and putting
            guards at the fourth, there seizes the people
            as they run out from the fire; he ties
            their arms behind them, and marches them
            either to Joar or Cohone, where he sells
            them to the Europeans."

            A. Brue, the French director, gives
            much the same account, and
            says,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteX_FN6"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootX_FN6"></a> "That having received goods, he wrote to the
            King, that if he had a sufficient number
            of slaves, he was ready to trade with him.
            This Prince, as well as the other Negroe
            monarchs, has always a sure way of supplying
            his deficiencies, by selling his own
            subjects, for which they seldom want a
            pretence. The King had recourse to this
            method, by seizing three hundred of his
            own people, and sent word to the director,
            that he had the slaves ready to
            deliver for the goods." It seems, the
            King wanted double the quantity of goods
            which the factor would give him for these
            three hundred slaves; but the factor refusing
            to trust him, as he was already in
            the company's debt, and perceiving that this
            refusal had put the King much out of temper,
            he proposed that he should give him
            a licence for taking so many more of his
            people, as the goods he still wanted were
            <a name="P_109"></a>
            worth but this the King refused, saying
            "<em>It</em> might occasion a disturbance amongst
            his subjects."<a class="notelink" href="#NoteX_FN7"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootX_FN7"></a> Except in the above instance,
            and some others, where the power
            of the Negroe Kings is unlawfully exerted
            over their subjects, the slave-trade is carried
            on in Guinea with some regard to the laws
            of the country, which allow of none to be
            sold, but prisoners taken in their national
            wars, or people adjudged to slavery in punishment
            for crimes; but the largeness of
            <a name="P_110"></a>
            the country, the number of kingdoms or
            commonwealths, and the great encouragement
            given by the Europeans, afford frequent
            pretences and opportunities to the
            bold designing profligates of one kingdom,
            to surprize and seize upon not only those of
            a neighbouring government, but also the
            weak and helpless of their
            own;<a class="notelink" href="#NoteX_FN8"><sup>C</sup></a><a name="FootX_FN8"></a> and the
            unhappy people, taken on those occasions,
            are, with impunity, sold to the Europeans.
            These practices are doubtless disapproved of
            by the most considerate amongst the Negroes,
            for Bosman acquaints us, that even their national
            wars are not agreeable to such. He
            says,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteX_FN9"><sup>D</sup></a><a name="FootX_FN9"></a> "If the person who occasioned the
            beginning of the war be taken, they will
            not easily admit him to ransom, though his
            weight in gold should be offered, for fear
            he should in future form some new design
            against their repose."

            sensible his own conduct was not justifiable; and it
            likewise appears, the factor's only concern was to procure
            the greatest number of slaves, without any regard
            to the injustice of the method by which they
            were procured. This Andrew Brue, was, for a long
            time, principal director of the French African factory
            in those parts; in the management of which, he is in
            the collection said to have had extraordinary success.
            The part he ought to have acted as a christian towards
            the ignorant Africans seems quite out of the question;
            the profit of his employers appears to have been his
            sole concern. At page 62, speaking of the country on
            the Senegal river, he says, "It was very populous, the
            soil rich; and if the people were industrious, they
            might, of their own produce, carry on a very advantageous
            trade with strangers; there being but few
            things in which they could be excelled; <em>but</em> (he adds)
            <em>it is to be hoped, the Europeans will never let them into
               the secret.</em>" A remark unbecoming humanity, much
            more christianity!
         </p>
         <p><a name="NoteX_FN8"></a><a href="#FootX_FN8">C</a>: This inhuman practice is
            particularly described by
            Brue, in collect. vol. 2. page 98, where he says, "That
            some of the natives are, on all occasions, endeavouring
            to surprize and carry off their country people.
            They land (says he) without noise, and if they find a
            lone cottage, without defence, they surround it, and
            carry off all the people and effects to their boat, and
            immediately reimbark." This seems to be mostly
            practised by some Negroes who dwell on the sea
            coast.

            First, Francis Moor, factor for the
            English African company, on the river
            Gambia,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteXI_FN1"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootXI_FN1"></a> writes,
            "That there are a number
            of Negro traders, called joncoes, or
            merchants, who follow the slave-trade as
            a business; their place of residence is so
            high up in the country as to be six
            weeks travel from James Fort, which is
            situate at the mouth of that river. These
            merchants bring down elephants teeth,
            and in some years two thousand slaves,
            most of which, they say, are prisoners
            taken in war. They buy them from the
            <a name="P_112"></a>
            different Princes who take them; many
            of them are Bumbrongs and Petcharies;
            nations, who each of them have different
            languages, and are brought from a vast
            way inland. Their way of bringing them
            is tying them by the neck with leather
            thongs, at about a yard distant from each
            other, thirty or forty in a string, having
            generally a bundle of corn or elephants
            teeth upon each of their heads. In their
            way from the mountains, they travel thro'
            very great woods, where they cannot for
            some days get water; so they carry in skin
            bags enough to support them for a time.
            I cannot (adds Moor) be certain of the
            number of merchants who follow this
            trade, but there may, perhaps, be about
            an hundred, who go up into the inland
            country, with the goods which they buy
            from the white men, and with them purchase,
            in various countries, gold, slaves,
            and elephants teeth. Besides the slaves,
            which the merchants bring down, there
            are many bought along the river: These
            are either taken in war, as the former are,
            or men condemned for crimes; <em>or else people
               stolen, which is very frequent</em>.&#8212;Since the
            slave-trade has been used, all punishments
            are changed into slavery; there being an
            advantage on such condemnation, <em>they
               <a name="P_113"></a>
               strain for crimes very hard, in order to get the
               benefit of selling the criminal</em>."

            John Barbot, the French factor, in his
            account of the manner by which the slaves
            are procured, says,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteXI_FN2"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootXI_FN2"></a> "The slaves sold by
            the Negroes, are for the most part prisoners
            of war, or taken in the incursions
            they make in their enemies territories;
            others are stolen away by their neighbours,
            when found abroad on the road,
            or in the woods; or else in the corn
            fields, at the time of the year when their
            parents keep them there all the day to
            scare away the devouring small birds."
            Speaking of the transactions on that part of
            Guinea called the Slave Coast, where the
            Europeans have the most factories, and
            from whence they bring away much the
            greatest number of slaves, the same author,
            and also Bosman<a class="notelink" href="#NoteXI_FN3"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootXI_FN3"></a> says, "The inhabitants
            of Coto do much mischief, in stealing those
            slaves they sell to the Europeans, from the
            upland country.&#8212;That the inhabitants
            of Popo excell the former; being endowed
            with a much larger share of courage,
            they rob more successfully, by
            which means they increase their riches
            and trade," The author particularly remarks,
            <a name="P_114"></a>
            "<em>That they are encouraged in this
               practice by the Europeans</em>; sometimes it
            happens, according to the success of their
            inland excursions, that they are able to
            furnish two hundred slaves or more, in a
            few days." And he says,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteXI_FN4"><sup>C</sup></a><a name="FootXI_FN4"></a> "The blacks
            of Fida, or Whidah, are so expeditious in
            trading for slaves, that they can deliver a
            thousand every month."&#8212;"If there
            happens to be no stock of slaves there,
            the factor must trust the blacks with his
            goods, to the value of one hundred and
            fifty, or two hundred pounds; which goods
            they carry up into the inland country,
            to buy slaves at all markets,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteXI_FN5"><sup>D</sup></a><a name="FootXI_FN5"></a> for above
            <a name="P_115"></a>
            six hundred miles up the country, where
            they are kept like cattle in Europe; the
            slaves sold there being generally prisoners
            of war, taken from their enemies like
            other booty, and perhaps some few sold
            by their own countrymen, in extreme
            want, or upon a famine, as also some as a
            punishment of heinous crimes." So far
            Barbot's account; that given by William
            Bosman is as follows:<a class="notelink" href="#NoteXI_FN6"><sup>E</sup></a><a name="FootXI_FN6"></a> "When the slaves
            which are brought from the inland countries
            come to Whidah, they are put in
            prison together; when we treat concerning
            buying them, they are all brought out
            together in a large plain, where, by our
            surgeons, they are thoroughly examined,
            and that naked, both men and women,
            without the least distinction or
            modesty.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteXI_FN7"><sup>F</sup></a><a name="FootXI_FN7"></a> Those
            <a name="P_116"></a>
            which are approved as good, are set
            on one side; in the mean while a burning
            iron, with the arms or name of the company,
            lies in the fire, with which ours are
            marked on the breast. When we have agreed
            with the owners of the slaves, they
            are returned to their prisons, where, from
            that time forward, they are kept at our
            charge, and cost us two pence a day each
            slave, which serves to subsist them like criminals
            on bread and water; so that to
            <a name="P_117"></a>
            save charges, we send them on board our
            ships the very first opportunity; before
            which, their masters strip them of all they
            have on their backs, so that they come on
            board stark naked, as well women as men.
            In which condition they are obliged to
            continue, if the master of the ship is not
            so charitable (which he commonly is) as to
            bestow something on them to cover their
            nakedness. Six or seven hundred are
            sometimes put on board a vessel, where
            they lie as close together as it is possible
            for them to be crowded."

            slaves brought thro' their several governments, to be shipped on board
            the European vessels, is considered, we have no cause
            to wonder that they give so great a countenance to
            that trade: William Bosman says, page 337, "<em>That
               each ship which comes to Whidah to trade, reckoning one
               with another, either by toll, trade, or custom, pays

               come hither in a year." Barbot confirms the same, and
               adds, page 350, "That in the neighbouring kingdom of
               Ardah, the duty to the King is the value of seventy or
               eighty slaves for each trading ship</em>." Which is near half
            as much more as at Whidah; nor can the Europeans,
            concerned in the trade, with any degree of propriety,
            blame the African Kings for countenancing it, while
            they continue to send vessels, on purpose to take in the
            slaves which are thus stolen, and that they are permitted,
            under the sanction of national laws, to sell them
            to the colonies.

         <p><a name="NoteXI_FN7"></a><a href="#FootXI_FN7">F</a>: Note, from the above account
            of the indecent and shocking manner in which the unhappy Negroes are
            treated, it is reasonable for persons unacquainted with
            these people, to conclude them to be void of that natural
            modesty, so becoming a reasonable creature; but
            those who have had intercourse with the Blacks in
            these northern colonies, know that this would be a
            wrong conclusion, for they are indeed as susceptible
            of modesty and shame as other people. It is the unparallel'd
            brutality, to which the Europeans have, by
            long custom, been inured, which urgeth them, without
            blushing, to act so shameful a part. Such usage is
            certainly grievous to the poor Negroes, particularly the
            women; but they are slaves, and must submit to this,
            or any other abuse that is offered them by their cruel
            task-masters, or expect to be inhumanly tormented into acquiescence.
            That the Blacks are unaccustomed
            to such brutality, appears from an instance mentioned
            in Ashley's collection, vol. 2. page 201, viz.
            "At an audience which Casseneuve had of the King
            of Congo, where he was used with a great deal of
            civility by the Blacks, some slaves were delivered
            to him. The King observing Casseneuve (according
            to the custom of the Europeans) to handle the
            limbs of the slaves, burst out a laughing, as did
            the great men about him: the factor asking the
            interpreter the occasion of their mirth, was told
            it proceeded from his so nicely examining the slaves.
            Nevertheless, <em>the King was so ashamed of it, that he
               desired him, for decency's sake, to do it in a more private
               manner.</em>"

            The misery and bloodshed attendant
            on the slave-trade, are set forth by the
            following extracts of two voyages to the
            coast of Guinea for slaves. The first in a
            vessel from Liverpool,

            "Sestro, December the 29th, 1724, No
            trade to day, though many traders came
            on board; they informed us, that the
            people are gone to war within land, and

            three days, in hopes of which we stay."

            The 30th. "No trade yet, but our traders
            came on board to day, and informed
            us the people had burnt four towns of
            their enemies, so that to-morrow we expect
            slaves off: another large ship is come
            in. Yesterday came in a large Londoner."

         </p>
         <p>
            The 31st. "Fair weather, but no trade
            yet; we see each night towns burning,
            but we hear the Sestro men are many of
            them killed by the inland Negroes, so
            that we fear this war will be unsuccessful."

         </p>
         <p>
            The 2d of January. "Last night we saw
            a prodigious fire break out about eleven
            o'clock, and this morning see the town
            of Sestro burnt down to the ground; (it
            contained some hundreds of houses) So that
            we find their enemies are too hard for
            them at present, and consequently our
            trade spoiled here; therefore, about seven
            o'clock, we weighed anchor, as did likewise
            the three other vessels, to proceed
            lower down."

         </p>
         <p>
            The second relation, also taken from the
            original manuscript Journal of a person of
            credit, who went surgeon on the same trade,
            in a vessel from New-York, about twenty
            years past, is as follows; <i>viz.</i> "Being on the
            coast, the Commander of the vessel, according
            to custom, sent a person on shore
            with a present to the King, acquainting
            <a name="P_120"></a>
            him with his arrival, and letting him
            know, they wanted a cargo of slaves. The
            King promised to furnish them with the
            slaves; and, in order to do it, set out to
            go to war against his enemies; designing
            to surprise some town, and take all the
            people prisoners. Some time after, the
            King sent them word, he had not yet met
            with the desired success; having been
            twice repulsed, in attempting to break up
            two towns, but that he still hoped to procure
            a number of slaves for them; and in
            this design he persisted, till he met his enemies
            in the field, where a battle was
            fought, which lasted three days, during
            which time the engagement was so bloody
            that four thousand five hundred men
            were slain on the spot." The person who
            wrote the account, beheld the bodies, as
            they lay on the field of battle. "Think
            (says he in his Journal) what a pitiable
            sight it was, to see the widows weeping
            over their lost husbands, orphans deploring
            the loss of their fathers, &amp;c. &amp;c." In
            he 6th vol. of Churchill's collection of Voyages,
            page 219, we have the relation of a
            voyage performed by Captain Philips, in a
            ship of 450 tuns, along the coast of Guinea,
            for elephants teeth, gold, and Negroe slaves,
            intended for Barbadoes; in which he says,
            that they took "seven hundred slaves on
            <a name="P_121"></a>
            board, the men being all put in irons two
            by two, shackled together to prevent their
            mutinying or swimming ashore. That the
            Negroes are so loth to leave their own
            country, that they often leap out of the
            canoe, boat, or ship, into the sea, and keep
            under water till they are drowned, to
            avoid being taken up, and saved by the
            boats which pursue them."&#8212;They
            had about twelve Negroes who willingly
            drowned themselves; others starved themselves
            to death.&#8212;Philips was advised
            to cut off the legs and arms of some to terrify
            the rest, (as other Captains had done)
            but this he refused to do. From the time of
            his taking the Negroes on board, to his arrival
            at Barbadoes, no less than three hundred
            and twenty died of various
            diseases.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteXII_FN1"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootXII_FN1"></a><a name="P_122"></a></p>

            That I may contribute all in my power towards
            the good of mankind, by inspiring any individuals
            with a suitable abhorrence of that detestable practice
            of trading in our fellow-creatures, and in some measure
            atone for my neglect of duty as a Christian, in engaging
            in that wicked traffic, I offer to their serious consideration
            some few occurrences, of which I was an eye-witness;
            that being struck with the wretched and affecting
            scene, they may foster that humane principle, which
            is the noble and distinguished characteristic of man, and
            improve it to the benefit of their children's children.
            <br><br>
            About the year 1749, I sailed from Liverpool to
            the coast of Guinea. Some time after our arrival, I
            was ordered to go up the country a considerable
            distance, upon having notice from one of the Negroe
            Kings, that he had a parcel of slaves to dispose
            of. I received my instructions, and went, carrying
            with me an account of such goods as we had on board,
            to exchange for the slaves we intended to purchase.
            Upon being introduced, I presented him with a
            small case of English spirits, a gun, and some trifles;
            which having accepted, and understood by an interpreter
            what goods we had, the next day was appointed
            for viewing the slaves; we found about two
            hundred confined in one place. But here how shall
            I relate the affecting sight I there beheld! How can
            I sufficiently describe the silent sorrow which appeared
            in the countenance of the afflicted father, and
            the painful anguish of the tender mother, expecting to
            be for ever separated from their tender offspring; the
            distressed maid, wringing her hands in presage of her
            future wretchedness, and the general cry of the innocent
            from a dreadful apprehension of the perpetual slavery to
            which they were doomed! Under a sense of my offence
            to God, in the persons of his creatures, I acknowledge I
            purchased eleven, whom I conducted tied two and two to
            the ship. Being but a small ship, (ninety ton) we soon
            purchased our cargo, consisting of one hundred and
            seventy slaves, whom thou mayest, reader, range in thy
            view, as they were shackled two and two together, pent
            up within the narrow confines of the main deck, with the
            complicated distress of sickness, chains, and contempt;
            deprived of every fond and social tie, and, in a great
            measure, reduced to a state of desperation. We had not
            been a fortnight at sea, before the fatal consequence of
            this despair appeared; they formed a design of recovering
            their natural right, LIBERTY, by rising and murdering
            every man on board; but the goodness of the Almighty
            rendered their scheme abortive, and his mercy
            spared us to have time to repent. The plot was discovered;
            the ring-leader, tied by the two thumbs over the
            barricade door, at sun-rise received a number of lashes:
            in this situation he remained till sun-set, exposed to the
            insults and barbarity of the brutal crew of sailors, with
            full leave to exercise their cruelty at pleasure. The consequence
            of this was, that next morning the miserable
            sufferer was found dead, flayed from the shoulders to the
            waist. The next victim was a youth, who, from too
            strong a sense of his misery, refused nourishment, and
            died disregarded and unnoticed, till the hogs had fed on
            part of his flesh. Will not christianity blush at this impious
            sacrilege? May the relation of it serve to call back
            the struggling remains of humanity in the hearts of those,
            who, from a love of wealth, partake in any degree of
            this oppressive gain; and have such an effect on the minds
            of the sincere, as may be productive of peace, the happy
            effect of true repentance for past transgressions, and a
            resolution to renounce all connexion with it for the time
            to come.

         <p>
            Reader, bring the matter home to thy own
            heart, and consider whether any situation can
            be more completely miserable than that of
            <a name="P_123"></a>
            these distressed captives. When we reflect
            that each individual of this number had probably
            some tender attachment, which was
            broken by this cruel separation; some parent
            or wife, who had not an opportunity of
            mingling tears in a parting embrace; perhaps
            some infants, or aged parents, whom
            his labour was to feed, and vigilance protect;
            themselves under the most dreadful apprehension
            <a name="P_124"></a>
            of an unknown perpetual slavery;
            confined within the narrow limits of a vessel,
            where often several hundreds lie as close as
            possible. Under these aggravated distresses,
            they are often reduced to a state of despair,
            in which many have been frequently killed,
            and some deliberately put to death under the
            greatest torture, when they have attempted
            to rise, in order to free themselves from present
            misery, and the slavery designed them.
            Many accounts of this nature might be mentioned;
            indeed from the vast number of vessels
            employed in the trade, and the repeated
            relations in the public prints of Negroes rising
            on board the vessels from Guinea, it is more
            than probable, that many such instances occur
            every year. I shall only mention one example
            of this kind, by which the reader may judge
            of the rest; it is in Astley's collection, vol. 2.
            p. 449, related by John Atkins, surgeon on
            board admiral Ogle's squadron, of one
            "Harding, master of a vessel in which several
            of the men-slaves and women-slaves
            had attempted to rise, in order to recover
            their liberty; some of whom the master,
            of his own authority, sentenced to cruel
            death, making them first eat the heart
            and liver of one of those he had killed.
            The woman he hoisted by the thumbs,
            whipped, and slashed with knives before
            <a name="P_125"></a>
            the other slaves, till she died."<a class="notelink" href="#NoteXII_FN2"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootXII_FN2"></a> As detestable
            and shocking as this may appear to
            such whose hearts are not yet hardened by the
            practice of that cruelty, which the love of
            <a name="P_126"></a>
            wealth by degrees introduceth into the human
            mind, it will not be strange to those who have
            been concerned or employed in the trade.

         <hr>
         <p><a name="NoteXII_FN2"></a><a href="#FootXII_FN2">A</a>: A
            memorable instance of some of the dreadful effects
            of the slave-trade, happened about five years past, on a
            ship from this port, then at anchor about three miles
            from shore, near Acra Fort, on the coast of Guinea.
            They had purchased between four and five hundred
            Negroes, and were ready to sail for the West Indies. It
            is customary on board those vessels, to keep the men
            shackled two by two, each by one leg to a small iron
            bar; these are every day brought on the deck for the
            benefit of air; and lest they should attempt to recover
            their freedom, they are made fast to two common chains,
            which are extended on each side the main deck; the
            women and children are loose. This was the situation
            of the slaves on board this vessel, when it took fire by
            means of a person who was drawing spirits by the light
            of a lamp; the cask bursting, the fire spread with so
            much violence, that in about ten minutes, the sailors,
            apprehending it impossible to extinguish it before it
            could reach a large quantity of powder they had on
            board, concluded it necessary to cast themselves into the
            sea, as the only chance of saving their lives; and first
            they endeavoured to loose the chains by which the Negroe
            men were fastened to the deck; but in the confusion the
            key being missing, they had but just time to loose one
            of the chains by wrenching the staple; when the vehemence
            of the fire so increased, that they all but one
            man jumped over board, when immediately the fire
            having gained the powder, the vessel blew up with all
            the slaves who remained fastened to the one chain, and
            such others as had not followed the sailors examples.
            There happened to be three Portugueze vessels in sight,
            who, with others from the shore, putting out their
            boats, took up about two hundred and fifty of those
            poor souls who remained alive; of which number, about
            fifty died on shore, being mostly of those who were fettered
            together by iron shackles, which, as they jumped
            into the sea, had broke their legs, and these fractures
            being inflamed by so long a struggle in the sea, probably
            mortified, which occasioned the death of every one that
            was so wounded. The two hundred remaining alive,
            were soon disposed of, for account of the owners to other
            purchasers.

            Now here arises a necessary query to those
            who hold the balance of justice, and who
            must be accountable to God for the use they
            have made of it, That as the principles on
            which the British constitution is founded,
            are so favourable to the common rights of
            mankind, how it has happened that the laws
            which countenance this iniquitous traffic,
            have obtained the sanction of the legislature?
            and that the executive part of the government
            should so long shut their ears to continual
            reports of the barbarities perpetrated
            against this unhappy people, and leave the
            trading subjects at liberty to trample on the
            most precious rights of others, even without
            a rebuke? Why are the masters of vessels thus
            suffered to be the sovereign arbiters of the
            lives of the miserable Negroes, and allowed
            <a name="P_127"></a>
            with impunity thus to destroy (may I not properly
            say, <em>to murder</em>) their fellow-creatures;
            and that by means so cruel, as cannot be even
            related but with shame and horror?

            When the vessels arrive at their destined
            port in the colonies, the poor
            Negroes are to be disposed of to the planters;
            and here they are again exposed naked,
            without any distinction of sexes, to the
            brutal examination of their purchasers; and
            this, it may well be judged, is, to many,
            another occasion of deep distress. Add to
            this, that near connexions must now again be
            separated, to go with their several purchasers;
            this must be deeply affecting to all, but such
            whose hearts are seared by the love of gain.
            Mothers are seen hanging over their daughters,
            bedewing their naked breasts with
            tears, and daughters clinging to their parents,
            <a name="P_129"></a>
            not knowing what new stage of distress
            must follow their separation, or whether
            they shall ever meet again. And here
            what sympathy, what commiseration, do
            they meet with? Why, indeed, if they will
            not separate as readily as their owners think
            proper, the whipper is called for, and the
            lash exercised upon their naked bodies,
            till obliged to part. Can any human heart,
            which is not become callous by the practice
            of such cruelties, be unconcerned, even at
            the relation of such grievous affliction, to
            which this oppressed part of our species are
            subjected.

            In a book, printed in Liverpool, called
            <i>The Liverpool Memorandum</i>, which contains,
            amongst other things, an account of the
            trade of that port, there is an exact list of
            the vessels employed in the Guinea trade,
            and of the number of slaves imported in each
            vessel; by which it appears that in the year
            1753, the number imported to America by
            one hundred and one vessels belonging to
            that port, amounted to upwards of thirty
            thousand; and from the number of vessels
            employed by the African company in London
            and Bristol, we may, with some degree
            of certainty, conclude, there are one
            hundred thousand Negroes purchased and
            brought on board our ships yearly from the
            coast of Africa. This is confirmed in Anderson's
            <a name="P_130"></a>
            history of Trade and Commerce, lately
            printed; where it is said,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteXIII_FN1"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootXIII_FN1"></a> "That
            England supplies her American colonies with
            Negroe slaves, amounting in number to
            above one hundred thousand every year."
            When the vessels are full freighted with
            slaves, they sail for our plantations in America,
            and may be two or three months in the
            voyage; during which time, from the filth
            and stench that is among them, distempers
            frequently break out, which carry off commonly
            a fifth, a fourth, yea sometimes a
            third or more of them: so that taking all the
            slaves together, that are brought on board
            our ships yearly, one may reasonably suppose,
            that at least ten thousand of them die on
            the voyage. And in a printed account of
            the state of the Negroes in our plantations,
            it is supposed that a fourth part, more or less,
            die at the different islands, in what is called
            the seasoning. Hence it may be presumed,
            that at a moderate computation of the slaves
            who are purchased by our African merchants
            in a year, near thirty thousand die
            upon the voyage, and in the seasoning. Add
            to this, the prodigious number who are
            killed in the incursions and intestine wars,
            by which the Negroes procure the number
            of slaves wanted to load the vessels. How
            <a name="P_131"></a>
            dreadful then is this slave-trade, whereby
            so many thousands of our fellow creatures,
            free by nature, endued with the same rational
            faculties, and called to be heirs of the
            same salvation with us, lose their lives, and
            are, truly and properly speaking, murdered
            every year! For it is not necessary, in order
            to convict a man of murder, to make it appear
            that he had an <em>intention</em> to commit
            murder; whoever does, by unjust force or
            violence, deprive another of his liberty, and,
            while he hath him in his power, continues
            so to oppress him by cruel treatment, as eventually
            to occasion his death, is actually
            guilty of murder. It is enough to make
            a thoughtful person tremble, to think what
            a load of guilt lies upon our nation on this
            account; and that the blood of thousands of
            poor innocent creatures, murdered every
            year in the prosecution of this wicked trade,
            cries aloud to Heaven for vengeance. Were
            we to hear or read of a nation that destroyed
            every year, in some other way, as many
            human creatures as perish in this trade, we
            should certainly consider them as a very
            bloody, barbarous people; if it be alledged,
            that the legislature hath encouraged, and
            still does encourage this trade, It is answered,
            that no legislature on earth can alter the
            nature of things, so as to make that to be
            right which is contrary to the law of God,

            world) and opposeth the promulgation of the
            Gospel of <em>peace on earth, and good will to man</em>.
            Injustice may be methodized and established
            by law, but still it will be injustice, as much
            as it was before; though its being so established
            may render men more insensible of the
            guilt, and more bold and secure in the perpetration
            of it.

            Negroes. Reflections thereon.

         </p>
         <p>
            Doubts may arise in the minds of
            some, whether the foregoing accounts,
            relating to the natural capacity and good
            disposition of the inhabitants of Guinea,
            and of the violent manner in which they are
            said to be torn from their native land, are to
            be depended upon; as those Negroes who
            <a name="P_133"></a>
            are brought to us, are not heard to complain,
            and do but seldom manifest such a
            docility and quickness of parts, as is agreeable
            thereto. But those who make these objections,
            are desired to note the many discouragements
            the poor Africans labour under,
            when brought from their native land.
            Let them consider, that those afflicted strangers,
            though in an <em>enlightened Christian country</em>,
            have yet but little opportunity or encouragement
            to exert and improve their natural
            talents: They are constantly employed
            in servile labour; and the abject condition in
            which we see them, naturally raises an idea
            of a superiority in ourselves; whence we are
            apt to look upon them as an ignorant and
            contemptible part of mankind. Add to this,
            that they meet with very little encouragement
            of freely conversing with such of the
            Whites, as might impart instruction to them.
            It is a fondness for wealth, for authority, or
            honour, which prompts most men in their
            endeavours to excell; but these motives can
            have little influence upon the minds of the
            Negroes; few of them having any reasonable
            prospect of any other than a state of slavery;
            so that, though their natural capacities
            were ever so good, they have neither inducement
            or opportunity to exert them to
            advantage: This naturally tends to depress
            their minds, and sink their spirits into habits
            <a name="P_134"></a>
            of idleness and sloth, which they would,
            in all likelihood, have been free from, had
            they stood upon an equal footing with
            the white people. They are suffered, with
            impunity, to cohabit together, without being
            married; and to part, when solemnly
            engaged to one another as man and wife;
            notwithstanding the moral and religious laws
            of the land, strictly prohibiting such practices.
            This naturally tends to beget apprehensions
            in the most thoughtful of those
            people, that we look upon them as a lower
            race, not worthy of the same care, nor liable
            to the same rewards and punishments as ourselves.
            Nevertheless it may with truth be
            said, that both amongst those who have obtained
            their freedom, and those who remain
            in servitude, some have manifested a
            strong sagacity and an exemplary uprightness
            of heart. If this hath not been generally
            the case with them, is it a matter of surprize?
            Have we not reason to make the
            same complaint of many white servants,
            when discharged from our service, though
            many of them have had much greater opportunities
            of knowledge and improvement
            than the blacks; who, even when free, labour
            under the same difficulties as before:
            having but little access to, and intercourse
            with, the most reputable white people, they
            remain confined within their former limits
            <a name="P_135"></a>
            of conversation. And if they seldom complain
            of the unjust and cruel usage they have
            received, in being forced from their native
            country, &amp;c. it is not to be wondered at;
            it being a considerable time after their arrival
            amongst us, before they can speak our language;
            and, by the time they are able to
            express themselves, they have great reason
            to believe, that little or no notice would be
            taken of their complaints: yet let any person
            enquire of those who were capable of reflection,
            before they were brought from their
            native land, and he will hear such affecting
            relations, as, if not lost to the common
            feelings of humanity, will sensibly affect his
            heart. The case of a poor Negroe, not long
            since brought from Guinea, is a recent instance
            of this kind. From his first arrival,
            he appeared thoughtful and dejected, frequently
            dropping tears when taking notice
            of his master's children, the cause of which
            was not known till he was able to speak English,
            when the account he gave of himself
            was, "That he had a wife and children in
            his own country; that some of these being
            sick and thirsty, he went in the night
            time, to fetch water at a spring, where
            he was violently seized and carried away
            by persons who lay in wait to catch men,
            from whence he was transported to America.
            The remembrance of his family,
            <a name="P_136"></a>
            friends, and other connections, left behind,
            which he never expected to see any more,
            were the principal cause of his dejection
            and grief." Many cases, equally affecting,
            might be here mentioned; but one more instance,
            which fell under the notice of a person
            of credit, will suffice. One of these
            wretched creatures, then about 50 years of
            age, informed him, "That being violently
            torn from a wife and several children in
            Guinea, he was sold in Jamaica, where
            never expecting to see his native land or
            family any more, he joined himself to a
            Negroe woman, by whom he had two
            children: after some years, it suiting the
            interest of his owner to remove him, he
            was separated from his second wife and
            children, and brought to South Carolina,
            where, expecting to spend the remainder
            of his days, he engaged with a third wife,
            by whom he had another child; but here
            the same consequence of one man being
            subject to the will and pleasure of another
            man occurring, he was separated from
            this last wife and child, and brought into
            this country, where he remained a slave."
            Can any, whose mind is not rendered quite
            obdurate by the love of wealth, hear these
            relations, without being deeply touched
            with sympathy and sorrow? And doubtless
            the case of many, very many of these afflicted
            <a name="P_137"></a>
            people, upon enquiry, would be found
            to be attended with circumstances equally
            tragical and aggravating. And if we enquire
            of those Negroes, who were brought
            away from their native country when children,
            we shall find most of them to have been
            stolen away, when abroad from their parents,
            on the roads, in the woods, or watching
            their corn-fields. Now, you that have
            studied the book of conscience, and you
            that are learned in the law, what will you
            say to such deplorable cases? When, and
            how, have these oppressed people forfeited
            their liberty? Does not justice loudly call
            for its being restored to them? Have they
            not the same right to demand it, as any of us
            should have, if we had been violently snatched
            by pirates from our native land? Is it
            not the duty of every dispenser of justice,
            who is not forgetful of his own humanity,
            to remember that these are men, and to declare
            them free? Where instances of such
            cruelty frequently occur, and are neither
            enquired into, nor redressed, by those whose
            duty it is <em>to seek judgment, and relieve the oppressed</em>,
            Isaiah i. 17. what can be expected,
            but that the groans and cries of these sufferers
            will reach Heaven; and what shall we do
            <em>when God riseth up? and when he visiteth</em>, what
            will ye answer him? <em>Did not he that made
               them, make us; and did not one fashion us in
               the womb</em>? Job xxxi. 14.

            difficulties than many of them labour under
            at present. To let them suddenly free here,
            would be perhaps attended with no less difficulty;
            for, undiciplined as they are in religion
            and virtue, they might give a loose
            to those evil habits, which the fear of a master
            would have restrained. These are objections,
            which weigh with many well disposed
            people, and it must be granted, these are difficulties
            in the way; nor can any general
            <a name="P_139"></a>
            change be made, or reformation effected,
            without some; but the difficulties are not so
            great but that they may be surmounted.
            If the government was so considerate of the
            iniquity and danger attending on this practice,
            as to be willing to seek a remedy, doubtless
            the Almighty would bless this good
            intention, and such methods would be
            thought of, as would not only put an end
            to the unjust oppression of the Negroes, but
            might bring them under regulations, that
            would enable them to become profitable
            members of society; for the furtherance of
            which, the following proposals are offered
            to consideration: That all farther importation
            of slaves be absolutely prohibited; and
            as to those born among us, after serving
            so long as may appear to be equitable, let
            them by law be declared free. Let every
            one, thus set free, be enrolled in the county
            courts, and be obliged to be a resident,
            during a certain number of years, within
            the said county, under the care of the overseers
            of the poor. Thus being, in some
            sort, still under the direction of governors,
            and the notice of those who were formerly
            acquainted with them, they would be obliged
            to act the more circumspectly, and make
            proper use of their liberty, and their children
            <a name="P_140"></a>
            would have an opportunity of obtaining
            such instructions, as are necessary to the common
            occasions of life; and thus both parents
            and children might gradually become useful
            members of the community. And further,
            where the nature of the country would permit,
            as certainly the uncultivated condition
            of our southern and most western colonies
            easily would, suppose a small tract of land
            were assigned to every Negroe family, and
            they obliged to live upon and improve it,
            (when not hired out to work for the white
            people) this would encourage them to exert
            their abilities, and become industrious subjects.
            Hence, both planters and tradesmen
            would be plentifully supplied with chearful
            and willing-minded labourers, much vacant
            land would be cultivated, the produce of
            the country be justly increased, the taxes
            for the support of government lessened to
            individuals, by the increase of taxables, and
            the Negroes, instead of being an object of
            terror,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteXIV_FN1"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootXIV_FN1"></a> as
            they certainly must be to the governments
            <a name="P_141"></a>
            where their numbers are great,
            would become interested in their safety and
            welfare.

            Answer to a mistaken opinion,
            that the warmth of the climate in the West-Indies,
            will not permit white people to labour
            there. No complaint of disability
            in the whites, in that respect, in the settlement
            of the islands. Idleness and diseases
            prevailed, as the use of slaves increased.
            <em>The great</em> advantage which might accrue
            to the British nation, if the slave trade
            was entirely laid aside, and a fair and
            friendly commerce established through the
            whole coast of Africa.

         </p>
         <p>
            It is frequently offered as an argument,
            in vindication of the use of Negroe slaves,
            that the warmth of the climate in the West
            Indies will not permit white people to labour
            in the culture of the land: but upon
            an acquaintance with the nature of the climate,
            and its effects upon such labouring
            <a name="P_142"></a>
            white people, as are prudent and moderate
            in labour, and the use of spirituous liquors,
            this will be found to be a mistaken opinion.
            Those islands were, at first, wholly cultivated
            by white men; the encouragement they
            then met with, for a long course of years,
            was such as occasioned a great increase of
            people. Richard Ligon, in his history of
            Barbadoes, where he resided from the year
            1647 to 1650, about 24 years after his first
            settlement, writes, "that there were then
            fifty thousand souls on that island, besides
            Negroes; and that though the weather
            was very hot, yet not so scalding
            but that servants, both christians and
            slaves, laboured ten hours a day." By
            other accounts we gather, that the white
            people have since decreased to less than one
            half the number which was there at that
            time; and by relations of the first settlements
            of the other islands, we do not meet
            with any complaints of unfitness in the white
            people for labour there, before slaves were
            introduced. The island of Hispaniola, which
            is one of the largest of those islands, was at
            first planted by the Buccaneers, a set of hardy
            laborious men, who continued so for a
            long course of years; till following the example
            of their neighbours, in the purchase
            and use of Negroe slaves, idleness and excess
            prevailing, debility and disease naturally
            <a name="P_143"></a>
            succeeded, and have ever since continued.
            If, under proper regulations, liberty
            was proclaimed through the colonies, the
            Negroes, from dangerous, grudging, half-fed
            slaves, might become able, willing-minded
            labourers. And if there was not a sufficient
            number of these to do the necessary
            work, a competent number of labouring
            people might be procured from Europe,
            which affords numbers of poor distressed objects,
            who, if not overlooked, with proper
            usage, might, in several respects, better answer
            every good purpose in performing the
            necessary labour in the islands, than the slaves
            now do.

         </p>
         <p>
            A farther considerable advantage might
            accrue to the British nation in general, if
            the slave trade was laid aside, by the cultivation
            of a fair, friendly, and humane commerce
            with the Africans; without which,
            it is not possible the inland trade of that
            country should ever be extended to the degree
            it is capable of; for while the spirit of
            butchery and making slaves of each other,
            is promoted by the Europeans amongst the
            Negroes, no mutual confidence can take
            place; nor will the Europeans be able to
            travel with safety into the heart of their
            country, to form and cement such commercial
            friendships and alliances, as might be
            necessary to introduce the arts and sciences
            <a name="P_144"></a>
            amongst them, and engage their attention
            to instruction in the principles of the christian
            religion, which is the only sure foundation
            of every social virtue. Africa has
            about ten thousand miles of sea coast, and
            extends in depth near three thousand miles
            from east to west, and as much from north
            to south, stored with vast treasures of materials,
            necessary for the trade and manufactures
            of Great-Britain; and from its climate,
            and the fruitfulness of its soil, capable, under
            proper management, of producing in
            the greatest plenty, most of the commodities
            which are imported into Europe from those
            parts of America subject to the English
            government;<a class="notelink" href="#NoteXV_FN1"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootXV_FN1"></a> and
            as, in return, they would
            take our manufactures, the advantages of
            this trade would soon become so great,
            that it is evident this subject merits the regard
            and attention of the government.

            Some persons respectable in the law,
            having given it as their opinion,
            "<i>That a slave, by coming from the West Indies
               to Great Britain or Ireland, either with or
               without his master, doth not become free, or
               that his master's property or right in him is
               not thereby determined or varied;&#8212;and
               that the master may legally compel him to return
               again to the plantations</i>,"&#8212;this
            causes our author to remark, that these
            lawyers, by thus stating the case merely
            on one side of the question, (I mean in favour
            of the master) have occasioned an unjust presumption
            and prejudice, plainly inconsistent
            with the laws of the realm, and against the
            other side of the question; as they have not
            signified that their opinion was only conditional,
            and not absolute, and must be understood
            on the part of the master, "<i>That he can
               produce an authentic agreement or contract
               in writing, by which it shall appear, that
               the said slave hath voluntarily bound himself,
               without compulsion or illegal duress</i>."

         </p>
         <p>
            Page 5. Indeed there are many instances of
            persons being freed from slavery by the laws
            <a name="P_148"></a>
            of England, but (God be thanked) there is
            neither law, nor even a precedent, (at least I
            have not been able to find one) of a legal
            determination to justify a master in claiming
            or detaining any person whatsoever as a
            slave in England, who has not voluntarily
            bound himself as such by a contract in
            writing.

         </p>
         <p>
            Page 20. An English subject cannot be
            made a slave without his own free consent:
            but&#8212;a foreign slave is made a subject
            with or without his own consent: there
            needs no contract for this purpose, as in the
            other case; nor any other act or deed whatsoever,
            but that of his being landed in England;
            For according to statute 32d of Henry
            VIII. c. 16. Sect. 9. "<i>Every alien or stranger
               born out of the King's obeisance, not being
               denizen, which now or hereafter shall come
               into this realm, or elsewhere within the
               King's dominions, shall, after the said first
               of September next coming, be bounden by and
               unto the laws and statutes of this realm, and
               to all and singular the contents of the same.</i>"

         </p>
         <p>
            Now it must be observed, that this
            law makes no distinction of <i>bond or free</i>,
            neither of colours or complexions, whether
            of <i>black, brown</i>, or <i>white</i>; for "<i>every alien
               or stranger</i> (without exception) <i>are bounden
               by and unto the law</i>, &amp;c."

         </p>
         <p>
            This binding, or obligation, is properly
            <a name="P_149"></a>
            expressed by the English word <i>ligeance, (&agrave;
               ligando</i>) which may be either perpetual or
            temporary. Wood, b. I. c. 3. p. 37. But one
            of these is indispensably due to the Sovereign
            from all ranks and conditions of people;
            their being bounden unto the laws, (upon
            which the Sovereign's right is founded) expresses
            and implies this subjection to the laws;
            and therefore to alledge, that an alien is not
            a subject, because he is in bondage, is not
            only a plea without foundation, but a contradiction
            in terms; for every person who,
            in any respect, is in subjection to the laws,
            must undoubtedly be a subject.

         </p>
         <p>
            I come now to the main point&#8212;"<em>That
               every man, woman, or child, that now is, or
               hereafter shall be, an inhabitant or resiant of
               this kingdom of England, dominion of Wales,
               or town of Berwick upon Tweed,</em>" is, in
            some respect or other, the <em>King's subject</em>, and,
            as such, is absolutely secure in his or her <em>personal
               liberty</em>, by virtue of a statute, 31st Car.
            II. ch. 11. and particularly by the 12th Sect.
            of the same, wherein subjects of all conditions
            are plainly included.

         </p>
         <p>
            This act is expressly intended for the better
            securing the liberty of the subject, and for
            prevention of imprisonment beyond the seas.
            It contains no distinction of "<em>natural born,
               naturalized, denizen, or alien subject; nor of
               white or black, freemen, or even of bond-men</em>,"
            <a name="P_150"></a>
            (except in the case already mentioned <em>of a
               contract in writing</em>, by which it shall appear,
            <em>that the said slave has voluntarily bound himself,
               without compulsion or illegal duress</em>, allowed
            by the 13th Sect. and the exception likewise
            in the 14th Sect. concerning felons) but they
            are all included under the general titles of
            "<em>the subject, any of the said subjects, every
               such person</em>" &amp;c. Now the definition of the
            word "<em>person</em>," in its relative or civil capacity
            (according to Wood. b. I. c. 11. p. 27.)
            <em>is either the King, or a subject</em>. These are the
            <em>only capital distinctions</em> that can be made, tho'
            the latter consists of a variety of denominations
            and degrees.

         </p>
         <p>
            But if I were even to allow, that a <em>Negroe
               slave</em> is not a subject, (though I think I have
            clearly proved that he is) yet it is plain that
            such an one ought not to be denied the benefit
            of the King's court, unless the slave-holder
            shall be able to prove likewise that
            he is not, a <em>Man</em>; because <em>every man</em> may be
            <em>free</em> to sue for, and <em>defend his right in our
               courts</em>, says a stat. 20th Edw. III. c. 4. and
            elsewhere, according to law. And <em>no man, of
               what estate or condition</em> that he be, (here can
            be no exception whatsoever) <em>shall be put out
               of land or tenement, nor taken, nor imprisoned,
               nor disinherited, nor put to death, without being
               brought in answer by due process of the law</em>.
            28th Edw. III, c. 3, <em>No man</em> therefore, <em>of
               <a name="P_151"></a>
               what estate or condition that he be</em>, can lawfully
            be detained in England <em>as a slave</em>; because
            we have no law whereby a man <em>may be</em>
            condemned to <em>slavery</em> without his own consent,
            (for even convicted felons must "<em>in
               open court pray to transported</em>.") (See Habeas
            Corpus act, Sect. 14.) and therefore there
            cannot be any "<em>due process of the law</em>" tending
            to so base a purpose. It follows therefore,
            that every man, who presumes to detain
            <em>any person</em> whatsoever as a slave, otherwise
            than by virtue of a written contract, acts
            manifestly without "<em>due process of the law</em>,"
            and consequently is liable to the slave's
            "<em>action of false imprisonment</em>," because
            "<em>every man may be free to sue</em>," &amp;c. so that
            the slave-holder cannot avail himself of his
            imaginary <em>property</em>, either by the assistance
            of the common law, or of a court of
            equity, (<em>except it appears that the said slave
               has voluntarily bound himself, without compulsion
               or illegal duress</em>) for in both his suit
            will certainly appear both unjust and indefensible.
            The former cannot assist him, because
            the statute law at present is so far from supposing
            any man in a state of slavery, that it
            cannot even permit such a state, except in
            the two cases mentioned in the 13th and 14th
            Section of the Habeas Corpus act; and the
            courts of equity likewise must necessarily
            decide against him, because his mere mercenary
            <a name="P_152"></a>
            plea of <em>private property</em> cannot
            equitably, in a case between <em>man and man</em>,
            stand in competition with that <em>superior property</em>
            which every man must necessarily be
            allowed to have in his own <em>proper person</em>.

         </p>
         <p>
            How then is the slave-holder to secure
            what he esteems his <em>property?</em> Perhaps he will
            endeavour clandestinely to seize the supposed
            slave, in order to transport him (with or
            without <em>his consent</em>) to the colonies, where
            such property is allowed: but let him take
            care what he does, the very attempt is punishable;
            and even the making over his property
            to another for that purpose, renders
            him equally liable to the severe penalties of
            the law, for a bill of sale may certainly be
            included under the terms expressed in the
            Habeas Corpus act, 12th Sect. viz. "<em>Any warrant
               or writing for such commitment, detainer,
               imprisonment, or transportation," &amp;c.</em> It is also
            dangerous for a counsellor, or any other person
            <em>to advise</em> (see the act "shall be advising") such
            proceedings, by saying, "<em>That a master may
               legally compel him</em> (the slave) <em>to return again
               to the plantations</em>." Likewise an attorney,
            notary-public, or any other person, who
            shall presume to draw up, negotiate, of even
            to witness a bill of sale, or other instrument
            for such commitment, &amp;c. offends equally
            against the law, because "<em>All, or any person
               or persons, that shall frame, contrive, write,
               <a name="P_153"></a>
               seal, or countersign any warrant or writing for
               such commitment, detainer, imprisonment, or
               transportation; or shall be advising, aiding,
               or assisting in the same, or any of them</em>," are
            liable to all the penalties of the act. "<em>And the
               plaintiff, in every such action, shall have
               judgment to recover his treble costs, besides
               damages; which damages so to be given shall
               not be less than five hundred pounds</em>;" so that
            the injured may have ample satisfaction for
            their sufferings: and even a judge may not
            direct or instruct a jury contrary to this statute,
            whatever his private opinion may be concerning
            property in slaves; because <em>no order or
               command, nor no injunction</em>, is allowed to interfere
            with this <em>golden act of liberty</em>.

         </p>
         <p>
            &#8212;I have before observed, that the general
            term, "<i>every alien</i>," includes <em>all strangers
               whatsoever</em>, and renders them <em>subject</em> to the
            King, and the laws, during their residence in
            this kingdom; and this is certainly true,
            whether the aliens be Turks, Moors, Arabians,
            Tartars, or even savages, from any
            part of the world.&#8212;Men are rendered obnoxious
            to the laws by their offences, and
            not by the particular denomination of their
            rank, order, parentage, colour, or country;
            and therefore, though we should suppose
            that any particular body of people whatsoever
            were not known, or had in consideration
            by the legislature at the different times
            <a name="P_154"></a>
            when the severe penal laws were made, yet no
            man can reasonably conceive, that such men
            are exempted on this account from the penalties
            of the said laws, when legally convicted
            of having offended against them.

         </p>
         <p>
            Laws calculated for the moral purpose of
            preventing oppression, are likewise usually
            supposed to be everlasting, and to make up
            a part of our happy constitution; for which
            reason, though the kind of oppression to be
            guarded against, and the penalties for offenders,
            are minutely described therein, yet
            the persons to be protected are comprehended
            in terms as general as possible; that "<em>no person
               who now is, or hereafter shall be, an inhabitant
               or resiant in this kingdom</em>," (see Habeas
            Corpus act, Sect. 12th) may seem to be
            excluded from protection. The general
            terms of the several statutes before cited, are
            so full and clear, that they admit of no exception
            whatsoever; for all persons (Negroes
            as well as others) must be included in the terms
            "the subject;"&#8212;"<em>no subject of this realm that
               now is, or hereafter shall be, an inhabitant,
               &amp;c. any subject; every such person</em>;" see
            Habeas Corpus act. Also <em>every man</em> may be
            <em>free</em> to sue, &amp;c. 20th Edward III. cap. 4. and
            <em>no man, of what estate or condition that he be</em>,
            shall be taken or imprisoned, &amp;c. True
            justice makes no respect of persons, and can
            never deny, to any one that blessing to
            <a name="P_155"></a>
            which all mankind have an undoubted right,
            their <em>natural liberty</em>: though the law makes
            no mention of Negroe slaves, yet this is
            no just argument for excluding them from
            the general protection of our happy constitution.

         </p>
         <p>
            Neither can the objection, that Negroe
            slaves were not "had in consideration or
            contemplation," when these laws were
            made, prove any thing against them; but,
            on the contrary, much in their favour; for
            both these circumstances are strong presumptive
            proofs, that the practice of importing
            slaves into this kingdom, and retaining them
            as such, is an innovation entirely foreign to
            the spirit and intention of the laws now in
            force.

            &#8212;Page 79. A toleration of slavery is, in
            effect, a toleration of inhumanity; for there
            are wretches in the world who make no scruple
            to gain, by wearing out their slaves with continual
            labour, and a scanty allowance, before
            they have lived out half their natural days.
            It is notorious, that this is too often the case
            in the unhappy countries where slavery is
            tolerated.

         </p>
         <p>
            See the account of the European settlements
            in America, Part VI. Chap. 11. concerning
            the "<em>misery of the Negroes, great
               waste of them</em>," &amp;c. which informs us not
            only of a most scandalous profanation of the
            <a name="P_156"></a>
            Lord's day, but also of another abomination,
            which must be infinitely more heinous in the
            sight of God, viz. oppression carried to such
            excess, as to be even destructive of the human
            species.

         </p>
         <p>
            At present, the inhumanity of constrained
            labour in excess, extends no farther in England
            than to our beasts, as post and hackney-horses,
            sand-asses, &amp;c.

         </p>
         <p>
            But thanks to our laws, and not to the
            general good disposition of masters, that
            it is so; for the wretch who is bad enough
            to maltreat a helpless beast, would not spare
            his fellow man if he had him as much in his
            power.

         </p>
         <p>
            The maintenance of civil liberty is therefore
            absolutely necessary to prevent an increase of
            our national guilt, by the addition of the horrid
            crime of tyranny.&#8212;Notwithstanding that
            the plea of necessity cannot here be urged, yet
            this is no reason why an increase of the practice
            is not to be feared.

         </p>
         <p>
            Our North American colonies afford us a
            melancholy instance to the contrary; for
            though the climate in general is so wholesome
            and temperate, that it will not authorise
            this plea of necessity for the employment
            of slaves, any more than our own, yet the
            pernicious practice of slave-holding is become
            almost general in those parts. At New-York,
            for instance, the infringement on civil
            <a name="P_157"></a>
            or domestic liberty is become notorious,
            notwithstanding the political controversies
            of the inhabitants in praise of liberty; but
            no panegyric on this subject (howsoever
            elegant in itself) can be graceful or edifying
            from the mouth or pen of one of those
            provincials, because men who do not scruple
            to detain others in slavery, have but a very
            partial and unjust claim to the protection of
            the laws of liberty; and indeed it too plainly
            appears that they have no real regard for
            liberty, farther than their own private
            interests are concerned; and (consequently)
            that they have so little detestation of despotism
            and tyranny, that they do not scruple to
            exercise them whenever their caprice excites
            them, or their private interest seems to require
            an exertion of their power over their miserable
            slaves.

         </p>
         <p>
            Every petty planter, who avails himself of
            the service of slaves, is an arbitrary monarch,
            or rather a lawless Bashaw in his own territories,
            notwithstanding that the imaginary freedom
            of the province wherein he resides, may
            seem to forbid the observation.

         </p>
         <p>
            The boasted liberty of our American colonies,
            therefore, has so little right to that
            sacred name, that it seems to differ from the
            arbitrary power of despotic monarchs only
            in one circumstance, viz. that it is a <em>many-headed
               monster of tyranny</em>, which entirely subverts
            <a name="P_158"></a>
            our most excellent constitution; because
            liberty and slavery are so opposite to each
            other, that they cannot subsist in the same
            community. "<em>Political liberty (in mild or
               well regulated governments) makes civil liberty
               valuable; and whosoever is deprived
               of the latter, is deprived also of the former</em>."
            This observation of the learned Montesquieu,
            I hope sufficiently justifies my censure of
            the Americans for their notorious violation
            of civil liberty;&#8212;The New-York Journal,
            or, The General Advertiser, for Thursday,
            22d October, 1767, gives notice by advertisement,
            of no less than eight different persons
            who have escaped from slavery, or are
            put up to public sale for that horrid purpose.

            That I may demonstrate the indecency of
            such proceedings in a free country, I shall
            take the liberty of laying some of these advertisements
            before my readers, by way of
            example.

            "<em>To be SOLD for want of Employment</em>,
            A likely strong active Negroe man, of
            about 24 years of age, this country born,
            (<i>N.B.</i> A natural born subject)
            understands most of a baker's trade, and a good deal
            of farming business, and can do all sorts
            of house-work.&#8212;Also a healthy Negroe
            wench, of about 21 years old, is a tolerable
            cook, and capable of doing all sorts
            <a name="P_159"></a>
            of house-work, can be well recommended
            for her honesty and sobriety: she has
            a female child of nigh three years old,
            which will be sold with the wench if required,
            &amp;c." Here is not the least consideration,
            or scruple of conscience, for the inhumanity
            of parting the mother and young
            child. From the stile, one would suppose the
            advertisement to be of no more importance
            than if it related merely to the sale of a cow
            and her calf; and that the cow should be sold
            with or without her calf, according as the
            purchaser should require.&#8212;But not only
            Negroes, but even American Indians, are detained
            in the same abominable slavery in our
            colonies, though there cannot be any reasonable
            pretence whatsoever for holding one
            of these as private property; for even if a
            written contract should be produced as a
            voucher in such a case, there would still remain
            great suspicion, that some undue advantage
            had been taken of the Indian's ignorance
            concerning the nature of such a bond.

            Upon the whole, I think I may with
            justice conclude, that those advertisements

            may be able, with too much justice, to retort
            this severe reflexion, and may refer us to
            news-papers published even in the free city
            of London, which contain advertisements not
            less dishonourable than their own. See advertisement
            in the Public Ledger of 31st December,
            1761.

            "<i>For SALE,
               A healthy NEGROE GIRL</i>, aged
            about fifteen years; speaks good English,
            works at her needle, washes well, does
            houshold work, and has had the small-pox.
            By J.W. &amp;c."

         </p>
         <p>
            Another advertisement, not long ago,
            offered a reward for stopping a female slave
            who had left her mistress in Hatton-garden.
            And in the Gazetteer of 18th April, 1769,
            appeared a very extraordinary advertisement
            with the following title;

         </p>
         <p>
            "<i>Horses, Tim Wisky, and black Boy</i>,
            To be sold at the Bull and Gate Inn. Holborn,
            <i>A very good Tim Wisky</i>, little the
            worse for wear, &amp;c." Afterwards, "<i>A Chesnut
               Gelding</i>;" then, "<i>A very good grey Mare</i>;"
            and last of all, (as if of the least consequence)
            "<i>A well-made good-tempered black Boy</i>, he has
            lately had the small-pox, and will be sold
            to any gentleman. Enquire as above."

         </p><a name="P_161"></a><p>
            Another advertisement in the same paper,
            contains a very particular description
            of a Negroe man, called <i>Jeremiah</i>,&#8212;and
            concludes as follows:&#8212;"Whoever delivers
            him to Capt. M&#8212;&#8212; U&#8212;&#8212;y, on
            board the Elizabeth, at Prince's Stairs, Rotherhithe,
            on or before the 31st instant,
            shall receive thirty guineas reward, or
            ten guineas for such intelligence as shall
            enable the Captain, or his master, effectually
            to secure him. The utmost secrecy
            may be depended on." It is not on account
            of shame, that men, who are capable
            of undertaking the desperate and wicked
            employment of kidnappers, are supposed to
            be tempted to such a business, by a promise
            "<em>of the utmost secrecy</em>;" but this must be from
            a sense of the unlawfulness of the act proposed
            to them, that they may have less reason
            to fear a prosecution. And as such a kind of
            people are supposed to undertake any thing
            for money, the reward of thirty guineas was
            tendered at the top of the advertisement,
            in capital letters. No man can be safe, be
            he white or black, if temptations to break
            the laws are so shamefully published in our
            news-papers.

         </p>
         <p><i>A Creole Black boy</i> is also offered to sale,
            in the Daily Advertiser of the same date.

         </p>
         <p>
            Besides these instances, the Americans
            may, perhaps, taunt us with the shameful
            <a name="P_162"></a>
            treatment of a poor Negroe servant, who
            not long ago was put up to sale by public
            auction, together with the effects of his bankrupt
            master.&#8212;Also, that the prisons of
            this free city have been frequently prostituted
            of late, by the tyrannical and dangerous
            practice of confining Negroes, under the
            pretence of slavery, though there have been
            no warrants whatsoever for their commitment.

         </p>
         <p>
            This circumstance of confining a man
            without a warrant, has so great a resemblance
            to the proceedings of a Popish inquisition,
            that it is but too obvious what dangerous
            practices such scandalous innovations,
            if permitted to grow more into use, are liable
            to introduce. No person can be safe,
            if wicked and designing men have it in their
            power, under the pretence of private property
            as a slave, to throw a man clandestinely,
            without a warrant, into goal, and to conceal
            him there, until they can conveniently
            dispose of him.

         </p>
         <p>
            A free man may be thus robbed of his liberty,
            and carried beyond the seas, without
            having the least opportunity of making
            his case known; which should teach us how
            jealous we ought to be of all imprisonments
            made without the authority, or previous
            examination, of a civil magistrate.

         </p>
         <p>
            The distinction of colour will, in a short
            <a name="P_163"></a>
            time, be no protection against such outrages,
            especially as not only Negroes, but
            Mulatoes, and even American Indians,
            (which appears by one of the advertisements
            before quoted) are retained in slavery
            in our American colonies; for there are
            many honest weather-beaten Englishmen,
            who have as little reason to boast of their
            complexion as the Indians. And indeed, the
            more northern Indians have no difference
            from us in complexion, but such as is occasioned
            by the climate, or different way of
            living. The plea of private property, therefore,
            cannot, by any means, justify a private
            commitment of any person whatsoever to
            prison, because of the apparent danger and
            tendency of such innovation. This dangerous
            practice of concealing in prison
            was attempted in the case of Jonathan
            Strong; for the door-keeper of the
            P&#8212;&#8212;lt&#8212;&#8212;y C&#8212;&#8212;pt&#8212;&#8212;r
            (or some person who acted for
            him) absolutely refused, for two days, to permit
            this poor injured Negro to be seen or
            spoke with, though a person went on purpose,
            both those days, to demand the same.&#8212;All laws ought to
            be founded upon the principle of "<em>doing
               as one would be done by</em>;"
            and indeed this principle seems to be the
            very basis of the English constitution; for
            what precaution could possibly be more effectual
            for that purpose, than the right we
            <a name="P_164"></a>
            enjoy of being judged by our Peers, creditable
            persons of the vicinage; especially, as
            we may likewise claim the right of excepting
            against any particular juryman, who might
            be suspected of partiality.

         </p>
         <p>
            This law breathes the pure spirit of liberty,
            equity, and social love; being calculated
            to maintain that consideration and mutual
            regard which one person ought to have for
            another, howsoever unequal in rank or station.

         </p>
         <p>
            But when any part of the community, under
            the pretence of private property, is deprived
            of this common privilege, it is a violation
            of civil liberty, which is entirely inconsistent
            with the social principles of a free
            state.

         </p>
         <p>
            True liberty protects the labourer as well
            as his Lord; preserves the dignity of human
            nature, and seldom fails to render a
            province rich and populous; whereas, on
            the other hand, a toleration of slavery is the
            highest breach of social virtue, and not only
            tends to depopulation, but too often renders
            the minds of both masters and slaves utterly
            depraved and inhuman, by the hateful extremes
            of exaltation and depression.

         </p>
         <p>
            If such a toleration should ever be generally
            admitted in England, (which God forbid)
            we shall no longer deserve to be esteemed
            a civilized people; because, when the
            <a name="P_165"></a>
            customs of uncivilized nations, and the <em>uncivilized
               customs which disgrace our own colonies</em>,
            are become so familiar as to be permitted
            amongst us with impunity, we ourselves
            must insensibly degenerate to the same degree
            of baseness with those from whom
            such bad customs were derived; and may,
            too soon, have the mortification to see the
            <em>hateful extremes of tyranny and slavery fostered
               under every roof</em>.

         </p>
         <p>
            Then must the happy medium of a well
            regulated liberty be necessarily compelled to
            find shelter in some more civilized country:
            where social virtue, and that divine precept,
            "<em>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself</em>," are
            better understood.

         </p>
         <p>
            An attempt to prove the dangerous tendency,
            injustice, and disgrace of tolerating
            slavery amongst Englishmen, would, in any
            former age, have been esteemed as superfluous
            and ridiculous, as if a man should undertake,
            in a formal manner, to prove, that
            darkness is not light.

         </p>
         <p>
            Sorry am I, that the depravity of the present
            age has made a demonstration of this
            kind necessary.

         </p>
         <p>
            Now, that I may sum up the amount of
            what has been said in a single sentence, I
            shall beg leave to conclude in the words of
            the great Sir Edward Coke, which, though
            <a name="P_166"></a>
            spoken on a different occasion, are yet applicable
            to this; see Rushworth's Hist. Col.
            An. 1628. 4 Caroli. fol. 450.

            Note, at page 63; According to the laws
            of Jamaica, printed in London, in 1756, "If
            any slave having been one whole year in
            this island, (says an act, No 64, clause 5,
            p. 114) shall run away, and continue absent
            from his owner's service for the space
            of thirty days, upon complaint and proof,
            &amp;c. before any two justices of the peace,
            and three freeholders, &amp;c. it shall and
            may be lawful for such justices and freeholders
            to order such slave to be punished,
            by <em>cutting off one of the feet of such slave</em>, or
            inflict such other corporal punishment as
            they <em>shall think fit</em>." Now that I may inform
            my readers, what corporal punishments are
            sometimes thought fit to be inflicted, I will
            refer to the testimony of Sir Hans Sloane,
            (see voyage to the islands of Madeira, Barbadoes,
            &amp;c. and Jamaica, with the natural history
            of the last of these islands, &amp;c. London
            <a name="P_167"></a>
            1707. Introduction, p. 56, and 57.) "The
            punishment for crimes of slaves (says he)
            are usually, for <em>rebellions</em>, burning them, by
            nailing them down to the ground with
            crooked sticks on every limb, and then
            applying the fire, by degrees, from the feet
            and hands, and burning them gradually up
            to the head, whereby <em>the pains are extravagant</em>;
            for crimes of a lesser nature,
            <em>gelding</em>, or <em>chopping off half the foot</em>
            with an axe. These punishments are suffered
            by them with great constancy.&#8212;For
            negligence, they are usually whipped by
            the overseers with lance-wood switches,
            till they be bloody, and several of the
            switches broken, being first tied up by
            their hands in the mill houses.&#8212;After
            they are whipped till they are raw,
            some put on their skins pepper and salt,
            to make them smart; at other times, their
            masters will drop melted wax on their
            skins, and use several <em>very exquisite torments</em>."
            Sir Hans adds, "These punishments are
            sometimes merited by the Blacks, who are
            a very perverse generation of people; and
            though they appear very harsh, yet are
            scarce equal to some of their crimes, and
            inferior to what punishments other European
            nations inflict on their slaves in the
            East-Indies, as may be seen by Moquet,
            and other travellers." Thus Sir Hans Sloane
            <a name="P_168"></a>
            endeavours to excuse those shocking cruelties,
            but certainly in vain, because no crimes
            whatsoever can merit such severe punishments,
            unless I except the crimes of those
            who devise and inflict them. Sir Hans Sloane,
            indeed, mentions <em>rebellion</em> as the principal
            crime; and certainly it is very justly esteemed
            a most heinous crime, in a land of liberty,
            where government is limited by equitable
            and just laws, if the same are tolerably
            well observed; but in countries where arbitrary
            power is exercised with such intolerable
            cruelty as is before described, if resistance
            be a crime, it is certainly the most natural of
            all others.

         </p>
         <p>
            But the 19th clause of the 38th act,
            would indeed, on a slight perusal, induce us
            to conceive, that the punishment for rebellion
            is not so severe as it is represented by Sir
            Hans Sloane; because a slave, though <em>deemed
               rebellious</em>, is thereby condemned to no
            greater punishment than transportation. Nevertheless,
            if the clause be thoroughly considered,
            we shall find no reason to commend
            the mercy of the legislature; for it only
            proves, that the Jamaica law-makers will
            not scruple to charge the slightest and most
            natural offences with the most opprobrious
            epithets; and that a poor slave, who perhaps
            has no otherwise incurred his master's
            <a name="P_169"></a>
            displeasure than by endeavouring (upon the
            just and warrantable principles of self-preservation,)
            to escape from his master's tyranny,
            without any criminal intention whatsoever,
            is liable to be <em>deemed rebellious</em>, and to be
            arraigned as a capital offender. "For every
            slave and slaves that shall run away, and
            continue but for the space of twelve months,
            except such slave or slaves as shall not have
            been three years in this island, shall be <em>deemed
               rebellious</em>," &amp;c. (see act 38, clause 19. p. 60.)
            Thus we are enabled to define what a West
            Indian tyrant means by the word <em>rebellious</em>.
            But unjust as this clause may seem, yet it is
            abundantly more merciful and considerate
            than a subsequent act against the same poor
            miserable people, because the former assigns
            no other punishment for persons so <em>deemed
               rebellious</em>, than that they, "<em>Shall be
               transported</em> by order of two justices and three
            freeholders," &amp;c. whereas the latter spares
            not the blood of these poor injured fugitives:
            For by the 66th act, a reward of 50 pounds
            is offered to those who "shall kill or bring
            in alive any <em>rebellious slaves</em>," that is, any
            of these unfortunate people whom the law
            has "<em>deemed rebellious</em>," as above; and this
            premium is not only tendered to commissioned
            parties (see 2d. clause) but even to any
            private "<em>hunter, slave, or other person</em>," (see 3d.
            <a name="P_170"></a>
            clause.) Thus it is manifest, that the law
            treats these poor unhappy men with as little
            ceremony and consideration as if they were
            merely wild beasts. But the innocent blood
            that is shed in consequence of such a detestable
            law, must certainly call for vengeance
            on the murderous abettors and actors of such
            deliberate wickedness: And though many of
            the guilty wretches should even be so hardened
            and abandoned as never afterwards to
            be capable of sincere remorse, yet a time will
            undoubtedly come, when they will shudder
            with dreadful apprehensions, on account of
            the insufficiency of so wretched an excuse,
            as that their poor murdered brethren were
            by law "<em>deemed rebellious</em>" But bad as
            these laws are, yet in justice to the freeholders
            of Jamaica, I must acknowledge,
            that their laws are not near so cruel and inhuman
            as the laws of Barbadoes and Virginia,
            and seem at present to be much more
            reasonable than they have formerly been;
            many very oppressive laws being now expired,
            and others less severe enacted in their
            room.

         <p>
            But it is far otherwise in Barbadoes; for
            by the 329th act, p. 125. "If any Negro
            or other slave, under punishment by his
            master, or his order, for running away,
            or any other crimes or misdemeanors towards
            <a name="P_171"></a>
            his said master, unfortunately shall
            suffer in life, or member, (which seldom
            happens) (but it is plain by this law that
            it does sometimes happen) <em>no person whatever
               shall be liable to any fine therefore; but
               if any man shall, of wantonness or only of
               bloody-mindedness, or cruel intention, wilfully
               kill a Negroe or other slave of his own</em>;"&#8212;now
            the reader, to be sure, will naturally
            expect, that some very severe punishment
            must in this case be ordained, to deter the
            <em>wanton, bloody-minded, and cruel</em> wretch, from
            <em>wilfully killing</em> his fellow creatures; but
            alas! the Barbadian law-makers have been
            so far from intending to curb such abandoned
            wickedness, that they have absolutely
            made this law on purpose to skreen these
            enormous crimes from the just indignation
            of any righteous person, who might think
            himself bound in duty to prosecute a bloody-minded
            villain; they have therefore presumptuously
            taken upon them to give a sanction,
            as it were, by law, to the horrid crime
            of wilful murder; and have accordingly ordained,
            that he who is guilty of it in Barbadoes,
            though the act should be attended
            with all the aggravating circumstances
            before-mentioned&#8212;"<em>shall
               pay into the public treasury</em>
            (no more than) <em>fifteen pounds sterling</em>," but
            if he shall kill another man's, he shall pay
            <a name="P_172"></a>
            the owner of the Negroe double the value,
            and into the public treasury <em>twenty-five
               pounds sterling</em>; and he shall further, by the
            next justice of the peace, be bound to his
            good behaviour during the pleasure of the
            governor and council, <em>and not be liable to any
               other punishment or forfeiture for the same</em>.

         </p>
         <p>
            The most consummate wickedness, I suppose,
            that any body of people, under the
            specious form of a legislature, were ever guilty
            of! This act contains several other clauses
            which are shocking to humanity, though too
            tedious to mention here.

         </p>
         <p>
            According to an act of Virginia, (4 Anne,
            ch. 49. sec. 37. p. 227.) "after proclamation
            is issued against slaves that run away and
            lie out, it is lawful for any person whatsoever,
            <em>to kill and destroy such slaves, by such
               ways and means as he, she, or they, shall think
               fit</em>, without accusation or impeachment of
            any crime for the same," &amp;c. And lest
            private interest should incline the planter to
            mercy, (to which we must suppose such people
            can have no other inducement) it is provided
            and enacted in the succeeding clause,
            (No 28.) "That for <em>every slave killed</em>, in pursuance
            of this act, or <em>put to death by law</em>,
            the master or owner of such slave <em>shall
               be paid by the public</em>."

         </p><a name="P_173"></a><p>
            Also by an act of Virginia, (9 Geo. I. ch. 4.
            sect. 18. p. 343.) it is ordained, "That,
            where any slave shall hereafter be found
            notoriously guilty of going abroad in the
            night, or running away, and lying out,
            and cannot be reclaimed from <em>such</em> disorderly
            courses by the common method of
            punishment, it shall and may be lawful
            to and for the court of the county, upon
            complaint and proof thereof to them made
            by the owner of such slave, to order and
            direct every such slave to be punished by
            <em>dismembering, or any other</em> way, not touching
            life, as the said county court <em>shall
               think fit</em>."

         </p>
         <p>
            I have already given examples enough of
            the horrid cruelties which are sometimes
            <em>thought fit</em> on such occasions. But if the innocent
            and most natural act of "<em>running away</em>"
            from intolerable tyranny, deserves
            such relentless severity, what kind of punishment
            have these law-makers themselves to
            expect hereafter, on account of their own
            enormous offences! Alas! to look for mercy
            (without a timely repentance) will only be
            another instance of their gross injustice!
            "<em>Having their consciences seared with a hot
               iron</em>," they seem to have lost all apprehensions
            that their slaves are men, for they scruple
            not to number them with beasts. See an
            <a name="P_174"></a>
            act of Barbadoes, (No 333. p. 128.) intituled,
            "An act for the better regulating of <em>outcries</em>
            in open market:" here we read of "<em>Negroes,
               cattle, coppers, and stills, and other
               chattels</em>, brought by execution to open
            market to be outcried, and these (as if
            all of equal importance) are ranged together
            <em>in great lots or numbers to be sold</em>."

         </p>
         <p>
            &#8212;Page 70. In the 329th act of Barbadoes,
            (p. 122.) it is asserted, that "brutish
            slaves deserve not, for the baseness of their
            condition, to <em>be tried by a legal trial of
               twelve men of their peers, or neighbourhood</em>,
            which neither truly can be rightly done,
            as the subjects of England are;" (yet
            slaves also are subjects of England, whilst
            they remain within the British dominions, notwithstanding
            this insinuation to the contrary)
            "nor is execution to be delayed towards
            them, in case of such horrid crimes committed," &amp;c.

         </p>
         <p>
            A similar doctrine is taught in an act of
            Virginia, (9 Geo. I. ch. 4. sect. 3. p. 339.)
            wherein it is ordained, "that every slave, committing
            such offence as by the laws ought
            to be punished by death, or loss of member,
            shall be forthwith committed to the common
            goal of the county, &amp;c. And the sheriff of
            such county, upon such commitment, shall
            forthwith certify the same, with the cause
            <a name="P_175"></a>
            thereof, to the governor or commander in
            chief, &amp;c. who is thereupon desired and impowered
            to issue a commission of Oyer and
            Terminer, <em>To such persons as he shall think fit</em>;
            which persons, forthwith after the receipt of
            such commission, are impowered and required
            to cause the offender to be publicly arraigned
            and tried, &amp;c. without the solemnity
            of a jury," &amp;c. Now let us consider
            the dangerous tendency of those laws. As
            Englishmen, we strenuously contend for this
            absolute and immutable necessity of trials by
            juries: but is not the spirit and equity of this
            old English doctrine entirely lost, if we partially
            confine that justice to ourselves alone,
            when we have it in our power to extend it to
            others? The natural right of all mankind,
            must principally justify our insisting upon
            this necessary privilege in favour of ourselves
            in particular; and therefore if we do not allow
            that the judgment of an impartial jury
            is indispensably necessary in all cases whatsoever,
            wherein the life of man is depending,
            we certainly undermine the equitable force
            and reason of those laws, by which <em>we ourselves
               are protected</em>, and consequently are unworthy
            to be esteemed either Christians or
            Englishmen.

         </p>
         <p>
            Whatever right the members of a provincial
            assembly may have to enact <em>bye laws</em>,
            <a name="P_176"></a>
            for particular exigences among themselves,
            yet in so doing they are certainly bound, in
            duty to their sovereign, to observe most
            strictly the fundamental principles of that
            constitution, which his Majesty is sworn to
            maintain; for wheresoever the bounds of
            the British empire are extended, there the
            common law of England must of course take
            place, and cannot be safely set aside by any
            <em>private law</em> whatsoever, because the introduction
            of an unnatural tyranny must necessarily
            endanger the King's dominions. The
            many alarming insurrections of slaves in the
            several colonies, are sufficient proofs of this.
            The common law of England ought therefore
            to be so established in every province,
            as to include the respective <em>bye laws</em> of each
            province; instead of being by them <em>excluded</em>,
            which latter has been too much the case.

         </p>
         <p>
            Every inhabitant of the British colonies,
            black as well as white, bond as well as free,
            are undoubtedly the <em>King's subjects</em>, during
            their residence within the limits of the King's
            dominions; and as such, are entitled to personal
            protection, however bound in service
            to their respective masters; therefore, when
            any of these are put to death, "<em>without the
               solemnity of a jury</em>," I fear that there is too
            much reason to attribute <em>the guilt of murder</em>
            to every person concerned in ordering, the
            <a name="P_177"></a>
            same, or in consenting thereto; and all such
            persons are certainly responsible <em>to the King
               and his laws, for the loss of a subject</em>. The
            horrid iniquity, injustice, and dangerous
            tendency of the several plantation laws
            which I have quoted, are so apparent, that
            it is unnecessary for me to apologize for the
            freedom with which I have treated them. If
            such laws are not absolutely necessary for the
            government of slaves, the law-makers must
            unavoidably allow themselves to be the most
            cruel and abandoned tyrants upon earth; or,
            perhaps, that ever were on earth. On the
            other hand, if it be said, that it is impossible
            to govern slaves without such inhuman
            severity, and detestable injustice, the same
            will certainly be an invincible argument
            against the least toleration of slavery amongst
            christians, because the temporal profit of the
            planter or master, however lucrative, cannot
            compensate the forfeiture of his everlasting
            welfare, or (at least I may be allowed
            to say) the apparent danger of such a forfeiture.

         </p>
         <p>
            Oppression is a most grievous crime, and
            the cries of these much injured people,
            (though they are only poor ignorant heathens)
            will certainly reach heaven! The
            scriptures (<em>which are the only true foundation
               of all laws</em>) denounce a tremendous judgment
            against the man who should offend
            <a name="P_178"></a>
            even one little-one; <em>"It were better for him</em>
            (even the merciful Saviour of the world
            hath himself declared) <em>that a millstone were
               hanged about his neck, and be cast into
               the sea, than that he should offend one of
               these little ones."</em> Luke xvii. 2. Who
            then shall attempt to vindicate those inhuman
            establishments of government, under
            which, even our own countrymen so grievously
            <em>offend</em> and <em>oppress</em> (not merely
            <em>one</em>, or a few little ones, but) an immense multitude
            of <em>men, women, children</em>, and the <em>children
               of their children</em>, from generation to generation?
            May it not be said with like
            justice, it were better for the English nation
            that these American dominions had never
            existed, or even that they should have been
            sunk into the sea, than that the kingdom of
            Great Britain should be loaded with the
            horrid guilt of tolerating such abominable
            wickedness! In short, if the <em>King's prerogative</em>
            is not speedily exerted for the relief of his
            Majesty's oppressed and much injured subjects
            in the British colonies, (because to <em>relieve
               the subject</em> from the oppression of petty
            tyrants is the principal use of the royal prerogative,
            as well as the principal and most natural
            means of maintaining the same) and for
            the extension of the British constitution to
            the most distant colonies, whether in the East
            or West Indies, it must inevitably be allowed,
            <a name="P_179"></a>
            that great share of this enormous guilt will
            certainly rest on this side the water.

         </p>
         <p>
            I hope this hint will be taken notice of by
            those whom it may concern; and that the
            freedom of it will be excused, as from a <em>loyal
               and disinterested</em> adviser.

            George Wallace, in his <i>System
               of the Principles of the Laws of Scotland</i>,
            speaking of the slavery of the Negroes
            in our colonies, says, "We all know that
            they (the Negroes) are purchased from their
            Princes, who pretend to have a right to dispose
            of them, and that they are, like other
            commodities, transported, by the merchants
            who have bought them, into America, in
            order to be exposed to sale. If this trade admits
            of a moral or a rational justification,
            every crime, even the most atrocious, may
            be justified. Government was instituted
            for the good of mankind; kings, princes,
            governors, are not proprietors of those who
            are subject to their authority; they have
            not a right to make them miserable. On the
            contrary, their authority is vested in them,
            that they may, by the just exercise of it,
            promote the happiness of their people. Of
            course, they have not a right to dispose of
            their liberty, and to sell them for slaves. Besides
            <a name="P_181"></a>
            no man has a right to acquire, or to
            purchase them; men and their liberty are not
            <i>in commercio</i>; they are not either
            saleable or purchaseable. One, therefore, has no body but
            himself to blame, in case he shall find
            himself deprived of a man, whom he
            thought he had, by buying for a price,
            made his own; for he dealt in a trade
            which was illicit, and was prohibited by
            the most obvious dictates of humanity. For
            these reasons, every one of those unfortunate
            men who are pretended to be slaves, has a
            right to be declared to be free, for he never
            lost his liberty; he could not lose it; his
            Prince had no power to dispose of him. Of
            course, the sale was <i>ipso jure</i> void.
            This right he carries about with him, and is entitled
            every where to get it declared. As soon,
            therefore, as he comes into a country in
            which the judges are not forgetful of their
            own humanity, it is their duty to remember
            that he is a man, and to declare him to
            be free. I know it has been said, that questions
            concerning the state of persons ought
            to be determined by the law of the country
            to which they belong; and that, therefore,
            one who would be declared to be a slave in
            America, ought, in case he should happen
            to be imported into Britain, to be adjudged,
            according to the law of America, to be a
            slave; a doctrine than which nothing can be
            <a name="P_182"></a>
            more barbarous. Ought the judges of any
            country, out of respect to the law of another,
            to shew no respect to their kind, and
            to humanity? out of respect to a law,
            which is in no sort obligatory upon them,
            ought they to disregard the law of nature,
            which is obligatory on all men, at all times,
            and in all places? Are any laws so binding
            as the eternal laws of justice? Is it doubtful,
            whether a judge ought to pay greater regard
            to them, than to those arbitrary and inhuman
            usages which prevail in a distant land?
            Aye, but our colonies would be ruined if
            slavery was abolished. Be it so; would it
            not from thence follow, that the bulk of
            mankind ought to be abused, that our pockets
            may be filled with money, or our mouths
            with delicacies? The purses of highwaymen
            would be empty, in case robberies were totally
            abolished; but have men a right to acquire
            money by going out to the highway?
            Have men a right to acquire it by rendering
            their fellow-creatures miserable? Is it lawful
            to abuse mankind, that the avarice, the
            vanity, or the passions of a few may be gratified?
            No! There is such a thing as justice
            to which the most sacred regard is due. It
            ought to be inviolably observed. Have not
            these unhappy men a better right to their
            liberty, and to their happiness, than our
            American merchants have to the profits which
            <a name="P_183"></a>
            they make by torturing their kind? Let,
            therefore, our colonies be ruined, but let us
            not render so many men miserable. Would
            not any of us, who should&#8212;be snatched
            by pirates from his native land, think himself
            cruelly abused, and at all times entitled
            to be free? Have not these unfortunate Africans,
            who meet with the same cruel fate, the
            same right? Are they not men as well as we,
            and have they not the same sensibility? Let
            us not, therefore, defend or support a usage
            which is contrary to all the laws of humanity.

            "But it is false, that either we or our colonies
            would be ruined by the abolition of
            slavery. It might occasion a stagnation of
            business for a short time. Every great alteration
            produces that effect; because mankind
            cannot, on a sudden, find ways of disposing
            of themselves, and of their affairs;
            but it would produce many happy effects.
            It is the slavery which is permitted in America,
            that has hindered it from becoming so
            soon populous as it would otherwise have
            done. Let the Negroes be free, and, in a few
            generations, this vast and fertile continent
            would be crowded with inhabitants; learning,
            arts, and every thing would flourish
            amongst them; instead of being inhabited by
            wild beasts, and by savages, it would be
            peopled by philosophers, and by men."

            Francis Hutcheson, professor of philosophy
            at the university of Glasgow, in his <i>System
               of Moral Philosophy</i>, page 211, says "He who
            detains another by force in slavery, is always
            bound to prove his title. The slave sold, or
            carried into a distant country, must not be
            obliged to prove a negative, that <em>he never
               forfeited his liberty</em>. The violent possessor
            must, in all cases, shew his title, especially
            where the old proprietor is well known. In
            this case, each man is the original proprietor
            of his own liberty. The proof of his losing
            it must be incumbent on those who deprive
            him of it by force. The Jewish laws had
            great regard to justice, about the servitude
            of Hebrews, founding it only on consent, or
            some crime or damage, allowing them always
            a proper redress upon any cruel treatment,
            and fixing a limited time for it; unless
            upon trial the servant inclined to prolong
            it. The laws about foreign slaves had many
            merciful provisions against immoderate
            severity of the masters. But under christianity,
            whatever lenity was due from an Hebrew
            towards his countryman, must be due
            towards all; since the distinctions of nations
            are removed, as to the point of humanity
            and mercy, as well as natural right;
            nay, some of these rights granted over foreign
            slaves, may justly be deemed only such
            indulgences as those of poligamy and divorce,
            <a name="P_185"></a>
            granting only external impunity in
            such practice, and not sufficient vindication
            of them in conscience."

         <p><i>Page</i> 85. It is pleaded, that "In some
            barbarous nations, unless the captives were
            bought for slaves, they would be all murthered.
            They, therefore, owe their lives,
            and all they can do, to their purchasers; and
            so do their children, who would not otherwise
            have come into life." But this whole
            plea is no more than that of <i>negotium utile
               gestum</i> to which any civilized nation is
            bound by humanity; it is a prudent expensive
            office, done for the service of others without
            a gratuitous intention; and this founds
            no other right, than that to full compensation
            of all charges and labour employed for
            the benefit of others.

            Just in the same manner, we, our nobles,
            and princes, often owe our lives to midwives,
            chirurgeons, physicians," &amp;c. one who
            was the means of preserving a man's life, is
            not therefore entitled to make him a slave,
            and sell him as a piece of goods. Strange,
            that in a nation where the sense of liberty
            prevails, where the christian religion is professed,
            custom and high prospects of gain
            can so stupify the conscience of men, and

            all sense of natural justice, that they can
            hear such computations made about the value
            of their fellow-men, and their liberty,
            without abhorrence and indignation.

            make slaves of their own species, when they
            certainly knew that this would involve in
            schemes of blood and murder, of destroying,
            or enslaving each other; that they even
            fomented wars, and engaged whole nations
            and tribes in open hostilities, for their own
            private advantage; that they had no detestation
            of the violence and cruelty, but only
            feared the ill success of their inhuman enterprises;
            that they carried men like themselves,
            their brethren, and the off-spring of
            the same common parent, to be sold like
            beasts of prey, or beasts of burden, and put
            them to the same reproachful trial, of their
            soundness, strength, and capacity for greater
            bodily service; that quite forgetting and
            renouncing the original dignity of human
            nature, communicated to all, they treated

            led to despise all their <em>pretended refinements of
               morality</em>; and to have concluded, that as
            they were not nations destitute of politeness,

            Mr. RIND,

         </p>
         <p>
            Permit me, in your paper, to address
            the members of our assembly on two
            points, in which the public interest is very
            nearly concerned.

         </p>
         <p>
            The abolition of slavery, and the retrieval
            of specie in this colony, are the subjects on
            which I would bespeak their attention.&#8212;

         </p>
         <p>
            Long and serious reflections upon the nature
            and consequences of slavery have convinced
            me, that it is a violation both of justice
            and religion; that it is dangerous to
            the safety of the community in which it
            prevails; that it is destructive to the growth
            of arts and sciences; and lastly, that it produces
            a numerous and very fatal train of vices,
            both in the slave and in his master.

         </p>
         <p>
            To prove these assertions, shall be the purpose
            of the following essay.

         </p>
         <p>
            That slavery then is a violation of justice,
            <a name="P_190"></a>
            will plainly appear, when we consider what
            justice is. It is truly and simply defined, as
            by <i>Justinian, constans et
               perpetua voluntas ejus suum cuique tribuendi</i>;
            a constant endeavour to give every man his right.

         </p>
         <p>
            Now, as freedom is unquestionably the
            birth-right of all mankind, <em>Africans</em> as well
            as <em>Europeans</em>, to keep the former in a state of
            slavery, is a constant violation of that right,
            and therefore of justice.

         </p>
         <p>
            The ground on which the civilians who
            favour slavery, admit it to be just, namely,
            consent, force, and birth, is totally disputable;
            for surely a man's own will and
            consent cannot be allowed to introduce so important
            an innovation into society, as slavery,
            or to make himself an outlaw, which is really
            the state of a slave; since neither consenting
            to, nor aiding the laws of the society in which
            he lives, he is neither bound to obey them,
            nor entitled to their protection.

         </p>
         <p>
            To found any right in force, is to frustrate
            all right, and involve every thing in
            confusion, violence, and rapine. With these
            two, the last must fall; since, if the parent
            cannot justly be made a slave, neither can
            the child be born in slavery. "The law of
            nations, says Baron <i>Montesquieu</i>, has doomed
            prisoners to slavery, to prevent their being
            slain; the <i>Roman</i> civil law permitted
            debtors, whom their creditors might treat
            <a name="P_191"></a>
            ill, to sell themselves. And the law of nature
            requires that children, whom their
            parents, being slaves, cannot maintain,
            should be slaves like them. These reasons of
            the civilians are not just; it is not true that
            a captive may be slain, unless in a case of
            absolute necessity; but if he hath been reduced
            to slavery, it is plain that no such necessity
            existed, since he was not slain. It is
            not true that a free man can sell himself, for
            sale supposes a price; but a slave and his property
            becomes immediately that of his
            master; the slave can therefore receive no
            price, nor the master pay, &amp;c. And if a
            man cannot sell himself, nor a prisoner of
            war be reduced to slavery, much less can his
            child." Such are the sentiments of this illustrious
            civilian; his reasonings, which I
            have been obliged to contract, the reader interested
            in this subject will do well to consult
            at large.

         </p>
         <p>
            Yet even these rights of imposing slavery,
            questionable, nay, refutable as they are, we
            have not to authorise the bondage of the
            <em>Africans</em>. For neither do they consent to be
            our slaves, nor do we purchase them of their
            conquerors. The <em>British</em> merchants obtain
            them from <em>Africa</em> by violence, artifice, and
            treachery, with a few trinkets to prompt
            those unfortunate people to enslave one
            another by force or stratagem. Purchase
            <a name="P_192"></a>
            them indeed they may, under the authority
            of an act of the British parliament. An
            act entailing upon the <em>Africans</em>, with whom
            we are not at war, and over whom a British
            parliament could not of right assume even a
            shadow of authority, the dreadful curse of
            perpetual slavery, upon them and their children
            for ever. <em>There cannot be in nature,
               there is not in all history, an instance in which
               every right of men is more flagrantly violated.</em>
            The laws of the antients never authorised
            the making slaves, but of those nations
            whom they had conquered; yet they were
            heathens, and we are christians. They were
            misled by a monstrous religion, divested of
            humanity, by a horrible and barbarous worship;
            we are directed by the unerring precepts
            of the revealed religion we possess, enlightened
            by its wisdom, and humanized by
            its benevolence; before them, were gods deformed
            with passions, and horrible for every
            cruelty and vice; before us, is that incomparable
            pattern of meekness, charity, love
            and justice to mankind, which so transcendently
            distinguished the Founder of christianity, and
            his ever amiable doctrines.

         </p>
         <p>
            Reader, remember that the corner stone of
            your religion, is to do unto others as you
            would they should do unto you; ask then
            your own heart, whether it would not abhor
            any one, as the most outrageous violater
            <a name="P_193"></a>
            of that and every other principle of right,
            justice, and humanity, who should make a
            slave of you and your posterity for ever!
            Remember, that God knoweth the heart; lay
            not this flattering unction to your soul, that
            it is the custom of the country; that you
            found it so, that not your will; but your necessity,
            consents. Ah! think how little such
            an excuse will avail you in that aweful day,
            when your Saviour shall pronounce judgment
            on you for breaking a law too plain to
            be misunderstood, too sacred to be violated.
            If we say we are christians, yet act more inhumanly
            and unjustly than heathens, with
            what dreadful justice must this sentence of
            our blessed Saviour fall upon us, "<em>Not every
               one that saith unto me Lord, Lord, shall
               enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that
               doth the will of my Father which is in heaven."</em>
            Matth. vii. 21. Think a moment
            how much your temporal, your eternal welfare
            depends upon an abolition of a practice
            which deforms the image of your God, tramples
            on his revealed will, infringes the most
            sacred rights, and violates humanity.

            Enough, I hope, has been asserted, to prove
            that slavery is a violation of justice and religion.
            That it is dangerous to the safety of
            the state in which it prevails, may be as
            safely asserted.

            What one's own experience has not taught;
            that of others must decide. From hence
            does history derive its utility; for being,
            when truly written, a faithful record of the
            transactions of mankind, and the consequences
            that flowed from them, we are thence furnished
            with the means of judging what will
            be the probable effect of transactions, similar
            among ourselves.

         </p>
         <p>
            We learn then from history, that slavery,
            wherever encouraged, has sooner or later
            been productive of very dangerous commotions.
            I will not trouble my reader here with
            quotations in support of this assertion, but
            content myself with referring those, who may
            be dubious of its truth, to the histories of
            Athens, Lacedemon, Rome, and Spain.

            How long, how bloody and destructive was
            the contest between the Moorish slaves and the
            native Spaniards? and after almost deluges of
            blood had been shed, the Spaniards obtained
            nothing more than driving them into the
            mountains.&#8212;Less bloody indeed, though,
            not less alarming, have been the insurrections
            in Jamaica; and to imagine that we shall be for
            ever exempted from this calamity, which experience
            teaches us to be inseparable from
            slavery, so encouraged; is an infatuation as
            astonishing as it will be surely fatal:&#8212;&amp;c. &amp;c.

            SERMON<br><br>
            PREACHED BY THE
            <br><br><br><br>BISHOP OF GLOUCESTER,
         </h2><a name="P_195"></a><p>
            Before the SOCIETY For the PROPAGATION
            of the GOSPEL, at the anniversary meeting
            on the 21st of <i>February</i>, 1766.

         </p>
         <p>
            From the free-savages, I now come
            (the last point I propose to consider) to
            the savages in bonds. By these I mean the
            vast multitudes yearly stolen from the opposite
            continent, and sacrificed by the colonists
            to their great idol, the GOD OF GAIN.
            But what then? say these sincere worshippers
            of <em>Mammon</em>; they are our own property
            which we offer up. Gracious God! to talk
            (as in herds of cattle) of property in rational
            creatures! creatures endowed with all our
            faculties; possessing all our qualities but that
            of colour; our brethren both by nature and
            <a name="P_196"></a>
            grace, shocks all the feelings of humanity,
            and the dictates of common sense. But,
            alas! what is there in the infinite abuses of
            society which does not shock them? Yet
            nothing is more certain in itself, and apparent
            to all, than that the infamous traffic
            for slaves directly infringes both divine and
            human law. Nature created man free,
            and grace invites him to assert his freedom.
            In excuse of this violation, it hath been
            pretended, that though indeed these miserable
            out-casts of humanity be torn from
            their homes and native country by fraud
            and violence, yet they thereby become the
            happier, and their condition the more
            eligible. But who are You, who pretend to
            judge of another man's happiness? That
            state, which each man, under the guidance
            of his Maker, forms for himself, and not
            one man for another? To know what constitutes
            mine or your happiness, is the sole
            prerogative of Him who created us, and cast
            us in so various and different moulds. Did
            your slaves ever complain to you of their
            unhappiness amidst their native woods and
            deserts? Or, rather, let me ask, did they
            ever cease complaining of their condition
            under you their lordly masters? where they
            see, indeed, the accommodations of civil
            life, but see them all pass to others, themselves
            unbenefited by them. Be so gracious
            <a name="P_197"></a>
            then, ye petty tyrants over human freedom,
            to let your slaves judge for themselves,
            what it is which makes their own happiness.
            And then see whether they do not place it
            in the return to their own country, rather
            than in the contemplation of your grandeur,
            of which their misery makes so large a part.
            A return so passionately longed for, that
            despairing of happiness here, that is, of
            escaping the chains of their cruel task-masters,
            they console themselves with feigning it to
            be the gracious reward of heaven in their
            future state, which I do not find their
            haughty masters have as yet concerned themselves
            to invade. The less hardy, indeed,
            wait for this felicity till over-wearied nature
            sets them free; but the more resolved have
            recourse even to self-violence, to force a speedier
            passage.

         </p>
         <p>
            But it will be still urged, that though
            what is called human happiness be of so fantastic
            a nature, that each man's imagination
            creates it for himself, yet human misery is
            more substantial and uniform throughout
            all the tribes of mankind. Now, from the
            worst of human miseries, the savage Africans,
            by these forced emigrations, are intirely secured;
            such as the being perpetually hunted
            down like beasts of prey or profit, by their
            more savage and powerful neighbours&#8212;In
            truth, a blessed change!&#8212;from being hunted
            <a name="P_198"></a>
            to being caught. But who are they that
            have set on foot this general HUNTING?
            Are they not these very civilized violaters
            of humanity themselves? who tempt the
            weak appetites, and provoke the wild passions
            of the fiercer savages to prey upon the
            rest.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
